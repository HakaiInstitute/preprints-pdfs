  abstract = {Despite numerous examples of ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM) addressing tradeoffs between ecological and commercial fishery interests, local social and cultural concerns are less frequently considered. We illustrate how Indigenous fishery harvest goals and data from locally driven wildlife research can inform EBFM, guided by cultural values of respect for and reciprocity with wildlife. Grizzly bears Ursus arctos horribilis hold particular importance for the Wuikinuxv First Nation in Rivers Inlet, British Columbia, where people and bears have coexisted as consumers of Sockeye Salmon Oncorhynchus nerka for millennia. The region’s valuable commercial fishery, active since the late 1800s, has been closed since the Sockeye Salmon population collapsed in the mid-1990s, but the Wuikinuxv maintain a modest food, social, and ceremonial (FSC) harvest. To address questions about balancing the needs of fishers and ecosystem recipients, we quantified tradeoffs between long-term maximum sustainable fishery yield and ecosystem benefits (for which bear density served as a proxy). We fitted age-structured state-space spawner–recruitment models and estimated relationships among spawner abundance, long-term fishery yields, and relative bear densities in time periods before and after the population collapse. We found that predicted maximum postcollapse bear density was 74\% of maximum precollapse densities. We estimated a 94\% decline in Sockeye Salmon equilibrium population size (from ˜3,115,000 to 200,000), resulting in a commensurate decline in maximum sustainable fishery yield. Despite this, we showed that Wuikinuxv FSC harvest goals are compatible with an EBFM target that seeks also to sustain relatively high bear densities, whereby relative fishery yield and bear density are reduced about 10\% from their respective maxima, assuming that current Sockeye Salmon productivity and carrying capacity remain similar for the foreseeable future, although these estimates are highly uncertain. Collectively, our findings illustrate how EBFM can apply interdisciplinary approaches that draw not only on fisheries ecology but also local values to design sustainable harvest strategies for diverse beneficiaries.},

Eelgrass (Zostera marina) meadows provide essential coastal habitat and are vulnerable to a temperature-sensitive wasting disease caused by the protist Labyrinthula zosterae. We assessed wasting disease sensitivity to warming temperatures across a 3500 km study range by combining long-term satellite remote sensing of ocean temperature with field surveys from 32 meadows along the Pacific coast of North America in 2019. Between 11\% and 99\% of plants were infected in individual meadows, with up to 35\% of plant tissue damaged. Disease prevalence was 3× higher in locations with warm temperature anomalies in summer, indicating that the risk of wasting disease will increase with climate warming throughout the geographic range for eelgrass. Large-scale surveys were made possible for the first time by the Eelgrass Lesion Image Segmentation Application, an artificial intelligence (AI) system that quantifies eelgrass wasting disease 5000× faster and with comparable accuracy to a human expert. This study highlights the value of AI in marine biological observing specifically for detecting widespread climate-driven disease outbreaks.},

  abstract = {This paper presents the results of a consensus-driven process identifying 50 priority research questions for historical ecology obtained through crowdsourcing, literature reviews, and in-person workshopping. A deliberative approach was designed to maximize discussion and debate with defined outcomes. Two in-person workshops (in Sweden and Canada) over the course of two years and online discussions were peer facilitated to define specific key questions for historical ecology from anthropological and archaeological perspectives. The aim of this research is to showcase the variety of questions that reflect the broad scope for historical-ecological research trajectories across scientific disciplines. Historical ecology encompasses research concerned with decadal, centennial, and millennial human-environmental interactions, and the consequences that those relationships have in the formation of contemporary landscapes. Six interrelated themes arose from our consensus-building workshop model: (1) climate and environmental change and variability; (2) multi-scalar, multi-disciplinary; (3) biodiversity and community ecology; (4) resource and environmental management and governance; (5) methods and applications; and (6) communication and policy. The 50 questions represented by these themes highlight meaningful trends in historical ecology that distill the field down to three explicit findings. First, historical ecology is fundamentally an applied research program. Second, this program seeks to understand long-term human-environment interactions with a focus on avoiding, mitigating, and reversing adverse ecological effects. Third, historical ecology is part of convergent trends toward transdisciplinary research science, which erodes scientific boundaries between the cultural and natural.},

  abstract = {Scientific management of wildlife requires confronting the complexities of natural and social systems. Uncertainty poses a central problem. Whereas the importance of considering uncertainty has been widely discussed, studies of the effects of unaddressed uncertainty on real management systems have been rare. We examined the effects of outcome uncertainty and components of biological uncertainty on hunt management performance, illustrated with grizzly bears (Ursus arctos horribilis) in British Columbia, Canada. We found that both forms of uncertainty can have serious impacts on management performance. Outcome uncertainty alone – discrepancy between expected and realized mortality levels – led to excess mortality in 19\% of cases (population-years) examined. Accounting for uncertainty around estimated biological parameters (i.e., biological uncertainty) revealed that excess mortality might have occurred in up to 70\% of cases. We offer a general method for identifying targets for exploited species that incorporates uncertainty and maintains the probability of exceeding mortality limits below specified thresholds. Setting targets in our focal system using this method at thresholds of 25\% and 5\% probability of overmortality would require average target mortality reductions of 47\% and 81\%, respectively. Application of our transparent and generalizable framework to this or other systems could improve management performance in the presence of uncertainty.},

  abstract = {Global biodiversity declines are increasingly recognized as profound ecological and social crises. In areas subject to colonialization, these declines have advanced in lockstep with settler colonialism and imposition of centralized resource management by settler states. Many have suggested that resurgent Indigenous-led governance systems could help arrest these trends while advancing effective and socially just approaches to environmental interactions that benefit people and places alike. However, how dominant management and conservation approaches might be decolonized (i.e., how their underlying colonial structure might be addressed, transformed, and replaced) is not always clear. Here, we describe a ‘Decolonial Model of Environmental Management and Conservation’ as an alternative paradigm to dominant approaches of conservation and management. The tenets of the model describe characteristics that might be expected of decolonized management, contrasted with those of dominant state-led approaches such as those embedded in the North American Model of Wildlife Conservation. The model does not prescribe how Indigenous governments or communities ought to govern their own territories, but instead offers insights into how external management and conservation agencies and practitioners might support (or stop impeding) Indigenous-led governance. We illustrate the model with a conservation ‘bright spot’: grizzly bear stewardship in the area now referred to as the Great Bear Rainforest in British Columbia, Canada, with a focus on work led by or in collaboration with, and within the territories of, the Haíɫzaqv, Kitasoo/Xai’xais, Nuxalk, and Wuikinuxv First Nations. While acknowledging the important context-specific variability among place-based management and conservation applications, we also discuss the model’s broader applicability.},

  abstract = {Human-wildlife conflicts impose considerable costs to people and wildlife worldwide. Most research focuses on proximate causes, offering limited generalizable understanding of ultimate drivers. We tested three competing hypotheses (problem individuals, regional population saturation, limited food supply) that relate to underlying processes of human-grizzly bear (Ursus arctos horribilis) conflict, using data from British Columbia, Canada, between 1960–2014. We found most support for the limited food supply hypothesis: in bear populations that feed on spawning salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.), the annual number of bears/km2 killed due to conflicts with humans increased by an average of 20\% (6–32\% [95\% CI]) for each 50\% decrease in annual salmon biomass. Furthermore, we found that across all bear populations (with or without access to salmon), 81\% of attacks on humans and 82\% of conflict kills occurred after the approximate onset of hyperphagia (July 1st), a period of intense caloric demand. Contrary to practices by many management agencies, conflict frequency was not reduced by hunting or removal of problem individuals. Our finding that a marine resource affects terrestrial conflict suggests that evidence-based policy for reducing harm to wildlife and humans requires not only insight into ultimate drivers of conflict, but also management that spans ecosystem and jurisdictional boundaries.},

For example, proponents and practitioners of the “North American Model of Wildlife Conservation,” which guides hunting policy across much of the United States and Canada, assert that science plays a central role in shaping policy. However, what that means is rarely defined. We propose a framework that identifies four fundamental hallmarks of science relevant to natural resource management (measurable objectives, evidence, transparency, and independent review) and test for their presence in hunt management plans created by 62 U.S. state and Canadian provincial and territorial agencies across 667 management systems (species-jurisdictions). We found that most (60\%) systems contained fewer than half of the indicator criteria assessed, with more criteria detected in systems that were peer-reviewed, that pertained to “big game,” and in jurisdictions at increasing latitudes. These results raise doubt about the purported scientific basis of hunt management across the United States and Canada. Our framework provides guidance for adopting a science-based approach to safeguard not only wildlife but also agencies from potential social, legal, and political conflict.},

Here, we show that, within their main population centre in the southwest Atlantic sector, the distribution of Euphausia superba (hereafter, ‘krill’) has contracted southward over the past 90\,years. Near their northern limit, numerical densities have declined sharply and the population has become more concentrated towards the Antarctic shelves. A concomitant increase in mean body length reflects reduced recruitment of juvenile krill. We found evidence for environmental controls on recruitment, including a reduced density of juveniles following positive anomalies of the Southern Annular Mode. Such anomalies are associated with warm, windy and cloudy weather and reduced sea ice, all of which may hinder egg production and the survival of larval krill5. However, the total post-larval density has declined less steeply than the density of recruits, suggesting that survival rates of older krill have increased. The changing distribution is already perturbing the krill-centred food web6 and may affect biogeochemical cycling7,8. Rapid climate change, with associated nonlinear adjustments in the roles of keystone species, poses challenges for the management of valuable polar ecosystems3.},

  abstract = {Introduction: The UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples states that indigenous people have a fundamental right to contribute to the management of the resources that support their livelihoods. Salmon are vital to the economy and culture of First Nations in coastal British Columbia, Canada. In this region, traditional systems of management including weirs – fences built across rivers to selectively harvest salmon – supported sustainable fisheries for millennia. In the late-19th century traditional fishing practices were banned as colonial governments consolidated control over salmon. Outcomes: In collaboration with the Heiltsuk First Nation we revived the practice of weir building in the Koeye River. Over the first four years of the project we tagged 1,226 sockeye, and counted 8,036 fish during fall stream walks. We used a mark-recapture model which accounted for both pre-spawn mortality due to variation in temperature, and tag loss, to produce the first mark-resight estimates of sockeye abundance in the watershed (4,600 – 15,000 escapement). Discussion: High river temperatures are associated with increased en route morality in migrating adult sockeye. We estimated pre-spawn mortality ranged from 8 – 72\% across the four years of study, highlighting the degree to which climate conditions may dictate future viability in sockeye salmon populations. These results demonstrate the power of fusing traditional knowledge and management systems with contemporary scientific approaches in developing local monitoring.},

Through generations of interdependence with salmon, Indigenous Peoples developed sophisticated systems of management involving cultural and spiritual beliefs, and stewardship practices. Colonization radically altered these social–ecological systems, disrupting Indigenous management, consolidating authority within colonial governments, and moving most harvest into mixed-stock fisheries. We review Indigenous management of salmon, including selective fishing technologies, harvest practices, and governance grounded in multigenerational place-based knowledge. These systems and practices showcase pathways for sustained productivity and resilience in contemporary salmon fisheries. Contrasting Indigenous systems with contemporary management, we document vulnerabilities of colonial governance and harvest management that have contributed to declining salmon fisheries in many locations. We suggest that revitalizing traditional systems of salmon management can improve prospects for sustainable fisheries and healthy fishing communities and identify opportunities for their resurgence.},

  abstract = {Climate change is subjecting aquatic species to increasing temperatures and shifting hydrologic conditions. Understanding how these changes affect individual survival can help guide conservation and management actions. Anadromous Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) in some large river systems are acutely impacted by the river temperatures and flows encountered during their spawning migrations. However, comparatively little is known about drivers of en route mortality for salmon in smaller coastal watersheds, and climate impacts may differ across watersheds and locally adapted salmon populations. To understand the effects of climate on the survival of coastal sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka; hísn in Haíɫzaqv), we tagged 1785 individual fish with passive integrated transponders across four migration seasons in the Koeye River—a low-elevation watershed in coastal British Columbia—and tracked them during their relatively short migration (∼13 km) from river entry to spawning grounds. Overall, 64.7\% of sockeye survived to enter the spawning grounds, and survival decreased rapidly when water temperatures exceeded 15 °C. The best-fitting model included an interaction between river flow and temperature, such that temperature effects were worse when flows were low, and river entry ceased at the lowest flows.

  abstract = {The Surface Ocean CO2 Atlas (SOCAT) is a synthesis of quality-controlled fCO2 (fugacity of carbon dioxide) values for the global surface oceans and coastal seas with regular updates. Version 3 of SOCAT has 14.7 million fCO2 values from 3646 data sets covering the years 1957 to 2014. This latest version has an additional 4.6 million fCO2 values relative to version 2 and extends the record from 2011 to 2014. Version 3 also significantly increases the data availability for 2005 to 2013. SOCAT has an average of approximately 1.2 million surface water fCO2 values per year for the years 2006 to 2012. Quality and documentation of the data has improved. A new feature is the data set quality control (QC) flag of E for data from alternative sensors and platforms. The accuracy of surface water fCO2 has been defined for all data set QC flags. Automated range checking has been carried out for all data sets during their upload into SOCAT. The upgrade of the interactive Data Set Viewer (previously known as the Cruise Data Viewer) allows better interrogation of the SOCAT data collection and rapid creation of high-quality figures for scientific presentations. Automated data upload has been launched for version 4 and will enable more frequent SOCAT releases in the future. High-profile scientific applications of SOCAT include quantification of the ocean sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide and its long-term variation, detection of ocean acidification, as well as evaluation of coupled-climate and ocean-only biogeochemical models. Users of SOCAT data products are urged to acknowledge the contribution of data providers, as stated in the SOCAT Fair Data Use Statement. This ESSD (Earth System Science Data) "living data" publication documents the methods and data sets used for the assembly of this new version of the SOCAT data collection and compares these with those used for earlier versions of the data collection (Pfeil et al., 2013; Sabine et al., 2013; Bakker et al., 2014).

  abstract = {To predict future coastal hazards, it is important to quantify any links between climate drivers and spatial patterns of coastal change. However, most studies of future coastal vulnerability do not account for the dynamic components of coastal water levels during storms, notably wave-driven processes, storm surges and seasonal water level anomalies, although these components can add metres to water levels during extreme events. Here we synthesize multi-decadal, co-located data assimilated between 1979 and 2012 that describe wave climate, local water levels and coastal change for 48 beaches throughout the Pacific Ocean basin. We find that observed coastal erosion across the Pacific varies most closely with El~Niño/Southern Oscillation, with a smaller influence from the Southern Annular Mode and the Pacific North American pattern. In the northern and southern Pacific Ocean, regional wave and water level anomalies are significantly correlated to a suite of climate indices, particularly during boreal winter; conditions in the northeast Pacific Ocean are often opposite to those in the western and southern Pacific. We conclude that, if projections for an increasing frequency of extreme El Niño and La Niña events over the twenty-first century are confirmed, then populated regions on opposite sides of the Pacific Ocean basin could be alternately exposed to extreme coastal erosion and flooding, independent of sea-level rise.},

  abstract = {The ocean knows no political borders. Ocean processes, like summertime wind-driven upwelling, stretch thousands of kilometers along the Northeast Pacific (NEP) coast. This upwelling drives marine ecosystem productivity and is modulated by weather systems and seasonal to interdecadal ocean-atmosphere variability. Major ocean currents in the NEP transport water properties such as heat, fresh water, nutrients, dissolved oxygen, pCO2, and pH close to the shore. The eastward North Pacific Current bifurcates offshore in the NEP, delivering open-ocean signals south into the California Current and north into the Gulf of Alaska. There is a large and growing number of NEP ocean observing elements operated by government agencies, Native American Tribes, First Nations groups, not-for-profit organizations, and private entities. Observing elements include moored and mobile platforms, shipboard repeat cruises, as well as land-based and estuarine stations. A wide range of multidisciplinary ocean sensors are deployed to track, for example, upwelling, downwelling, ocean productivity, harmful algal blooms, ocean acidification and hypoxia, seismic activity and tsunami wave propagation. Data delivery to shore and observatory controls are done through satellite and cell phone communication, and via seafloor cables. Remote sensing from satellites and land-based coastal radar provide broader spatial coverage, while numerical circulation and biogeochemical modeling complement ocean observing efforts. Models span from the deep ocean into the inland Salish Sea and estuaries. NEP ocean observing systems are used to understand regional processes and, together with numerical models, provide ocean forecasts. By sharing data, experiences and lessons learned, the regional ocean observatory is better than the sum of its parts.},

We analyse patterns of molecular detection in juvenile sockeye for the bacterium Tenacibaculum maritimum, known to cause disease in fish globally and to cause mouthrot disease in farmed Atlantic salmon in British Columbia. Our data show a clear peak in T. maritimum detections in the Discovery Islands region of British Columbia, where sockeye migrate close to salmon farms. Using well-established differential equation models to describe sockeye migration and bacterial infection, fit to detection data, we assessed support for multiple hypotheses describing farm- and background-origin infection. Our best models (with 99.8\% empirical support) describe constant background infection pressure, except around Discovery Islands salmon farms, where farm-origin infection pressure peaked at 12.7 (approximate 95\%~CI: 4.5 to 31) times background levels. Given the severity of associated disease in related species and the imperilled nature of Fraser River sockeye, our results suggest the need for a more precautionary approach to managing farm–wild interactions in sockeye salmon.},

  abstract = {Predicting outcomes of marine disease outbreaks presents a challenge in the face of both global and local stressors. Host-associated microbiomes may play important roles in disease dynamics but remain understudied in marine ecosystems. Host–pathogen–microbiome interactions can vary across host ranges, gradients of disease, and temperature; studying these relationships may aid our ability to forecast disease dynamics. Eelgrass, Zostera marina, is impacted by outbreaks of wasting disease caused by the opportunistic pathogen Labyrinthula zosterae. We investigated how Z. marina phyllosphere microbial communities vary with rising wasting disease lesion prevalence and severity relative to plant and meadow characteristics like shoot density, longest leaf length, and temperature across 23° latitude in the Northeastern Pacific. We detected effects of geography (11\%) and smaller, but distinct, effects of temperature (30-day max sea surface temperature, 4\%) and disease (lesion prevalence, 3\%) on microbiome composition. Declines in alpha diversity on asymptomatic tissue occurred with rising wasting disease prevalence within meadows. However, no change in microbiome variability (dispersion) was detected between asymptomatic and symptomatic tissues. Further, we identified members of Cellvibrionaceae, Colwelliaceae, and Granulosicoccaceae on asymptomatic tissue that are predictive of wasting disease prevalence across the geographic range (3,100 kilometers). Functional roles of Colwelliaceae and Granulosicoccaceae are not known. Cellvibrionaceae, degraders of plant cellulose, were also enriched in lesions and adjacent green tissue relative to nonlesioned leaves. Cellvibrionaceae may play important roles in disease progression by degrading host tissues or overwhelming plant immune responses. Thus, inclusion of microbiomes in wasting disease studies may improve our ability to understand variable rates of infection, disease progression, and plant survival. IMPORTANCE The roles of marine microbiomes in disease remain poorly understood due, in part, to the challenging nature of sampling at appropriate spatiotemporal scales and across natural gradients of disease throughout host ranges. This is especially true for marine vascular plants like eelgrass (Zostera marina) that are vital for ecosystem function and biodiversity but are susceptible to rapid decline and die-off from pathogens like eukaryotic slime-mold Labyrinthula zosterae (wasting disease). We link bacterial members of phyllosphere tissues to the prevalence of wasting disease across the broadest geographic range to date for a marine plant microbiome-disease study (3,100\,km). We identify Cellvibrionaceae, plant cell wall degraders, enriched (up to 61\% relative abundance) within lesion tissue, which suggests this group may be playing important roles in disease progression. These findings suggest inclusion of microbiomes in marine disease studies will improve our ability to predict ecological outcomes of infection across variable landscapes spanning thousands of kilometers.},

Many cultures recognize animals as non-human persons with decision-making agency. Such perspectives, termed “kincentric ecology,” suggest a relational approach to management that differs from convention in North America. We argue that kincentric perspectives are highly relevant to current approaches and issues in wildlife management, including the incorporation of Indigenous Knowledge. Using empirical research with the Xeni Gwet'in First Nation in British Columbia, Canada, we discuss four dimensions of kincentricity key to collaborative management, with notable parallels in emergent systems science: (1) shift in emphasis from human rights to responsibilities; (2) focus on social–ecological systems; (3) acknowledgment of uncertainty and rapid change; and (4) emphasis on locally relevant, empirical knowledge. Wildlife and land management influenced by bioculturally diverse knowledge implies a more systemic approach; adaptive processes; changed goals and values; and shifting responsibilities among stakeholders.},

Consequently, climate-mediated changes to coastal terrestrial ecosystems and hydrologic regimes have high potential to influence nearshore ocean chemistry and food web dynamics. Research from tightly coupled, high-flux coastal ecosystems can advance understanding of terrestrial–marine links and climate sensitivities more generally. In the present article, we use the northeast Pacific coastal temperate rainforest as a model system to evaluate such links. We focus on key above- and belowground production and hydrological transport processes that control the land-to-ocean flow of materials and their influence on nearshore marine ecosystems. We evaluate how these connections may be altered by global climate change and we identify knowledge gaps in our understanding of the source, transport, and fate of terrestrial materials along this coastal margin. Finally, we propose five priority research themes in this region that are relevant for understanding coastal ecosystem links more broadly.},

  abstract = {Forty years ago, Knut Fladmark (1979) argued that the Pacific Coast offered a viable alternative to the ice-free corridor model for the initial peopling of the Americas—one of the first to support a “coastal migration theory” that remained marginal for decades. Today, the pre-Clovis occupation at the Monte Verde site is widely accepted, several other pre-Clovis sites are well documented, investigations of terminal Pleistocene subaerial and submerged Pacific Coast landscapes have increased, and multiple lines of evidence are helping decode the nature of early human dispersals into the Americas. Misconceptions remain, however, about the state of knowledge, productivity, and deglaciation chronology of Pleistocene coastlines and possible technological connections around the Pacific Rim. We review current evidence for several significant clusters of early Pacific Coast archaeological sites in North and South America that include sites as old or older than Clovis. We argue that stemmed points, foliate points, and crescents (lunates) found around the Pacific Rim may corroborate genomic studies that support an early Pacific Coast dispersal route into the Americas. Still, much remains to be learned about the Pleistocene colonization of the Americas, and multiple working hypotheses are warranted., Hace cuarenta años, Knut Fladmark (1979) argumentó que la costa del Oceano Pacífico ofrecía una alternativa viable a la ruta de Corredor sin Hielo para la población inicial de las Américas. El era una de las primeras en apoyar una “teoría de la migración costera,” lo que permaneció marginal durante décadas. Hoy en día, la ocupación pre-Clovis en el sitio de Monte Verde es ampliamente aceptada, varios otros sitios pre-Clovis están bien documentados, las investigaciones de los sitios terrestres del Pleistoceno terminal y los paisajes sumergidos de la costa del Pacífico han aumentado, y múltiples líneas de evidencia están ayudando a descifrar los patrones de dispersion humana temprana en las Américas. Sin embargo, siguen existiendo conceptos erróneos sobre el estado del conocimiento, la productividad y la cronología de la deglaciación de las líneas costeras del Pleistoceno y las posibles conexiones tecnológicas a lo largo del Pacífico. Revisamos la evidencia actual de varios agrupaciones importantes de sitios arqueológicos de la costa del Pacífico temprano en América del Norte y del Sur que incluyen yacimientos más antiguos o más antiguos que Clovis. Argumentamos que los puntos proyectiles de pedúnculo, puntos foliares y crecientes (lunados) encontrados cerca del borde del Pacífico pueden corroborar los estudios genómicos que respaldan una ruta temprana de dispersión por la costa del Pacífico a través de las Américas. Queda mucho por aprender acerca de la colonización del Pleistoceno en las Américas y se justifican múltiples hipótesis de trabajo.},

We describe the abundance of both louse species infesting co-migrating juvenile pink (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha), chum (Oncorhynchus keta), and sockeye (Oncorhynchus nerka) salmon over 5 years in the Discovery Islands and Johnstone Strait, British Columbia. The generalist louse, C. clemensi, was 5, 7, and 39 times more abundant than the salmonid specialist, L. salmonis, on pink, chum, and sockeye salmon, respectively. Caligus clemensi abundance was higher on pink salmon (0.45, 95\% CI: 0.38–0.55) and sockeye (0.39, 95\% CI: 0.33–0.47) than on chum salmon. Lepeophtheirus salmonis abundance was highest on pink salmon (0.09, 95\% CI = 0.06–0.15). Caligus clemensi had higher abundances in Johnstone Strait than in the Discovery Islands. These results suggest differences in host specialization and transmission dynamics between louse species. Because both lice infest farmed salmon, but only C. clemensi infests Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii), conservation science and management regarding lice and Fraser River salmon should further consider C. clemensi and transmission from farmed salmon and wild herring.},

To examine broadly the chronic endocrine effects of a salmon niche, we compared cortisol, progesterone, and testosterone levels in hair from salmon-eating bears from coastal BC (n = 75) with the levels in a reference population from interior BC lacking access to salmon (n = 42). As predicted, testosterone was higher in coastal bears of both sexes relative to interior bears, possibly reflecting higher social density on the coast mediated by salmon availability. We also investigated associations between the amount of salmon individual bears consumed (as measured by stable isotope analysis) and cortisol and testosterone in hair. Also as predicted, cortisol decreased with increasing dietary salmon and was higher after a year of low dietary salmon than after a year of high dietary salmon. These findings at two spatial scales suggest that coastal bears might experience nutritional or social stress in response to on-going salmon declines, providing novel insights into the effects of resource availability on fitness-related physiology.},

  abstract = {Food availability can influence the nutritional and social dynamics within and among species. Our investigation focused on grizzly and black bears in coastal British Columbia, Canada, where recent and dramatic declines in their primary prey (salmon) raise concerns about potentially negative effects on bear physiology. We examined how salmon availability relates to stress and reproductive hormones in coastal grizzly (n\hspace{0.25em}=\hspace{0.25em}69) and black bears (n\hspace{0.25em}=\hspace{0.25em}68) using cortisol and testosterone. In hair samples from genotyped individuals, we quantified salmon consumption using stable isotope analysis and hormone levels by enzyme immunoassay. To estimate the salmon biomass available to each bear, we developed a spatially explicit approach based on typical bear home-range sizes. Next, we compared the relative importance of salmon consumption and salmon availability on hormone levels in male bears using an information theoretical approach. Cortisol in grizzly bears was higher in individuals that consumed less salmon, possibly reflecting nutritional stress. In black bears, cortisol was better predicted by salmon availability than salmon consumption; specifically, individuals in areas and years with low salmon availability showed higher cortisol levels. This indicates that cortisol in black bears is more strongly influenced by the socially competitive environment mediated by salmon availability than by nutritional requirements. In both species, testosterone generally decreased with increasing salmon availability, possibly reflecting a less competitive environment when salmon were abundant. Differences between species could relate to different nutritional requirements, social densities and competitive behaviour and/or habitat use. We present a conceptual model to inform further investigations in this and other systems. Our approach, which combines data on multiple hormones with dietary and spatial information corresponding to the year of hair growth, provides a promising tool for evaluating the responses of a broad spectrum of wildlife to changes in food availability or other environmental conditions.},

One such extinction of likely important consequence is the 18th century extinction of the Steller’s sea cow (Hydrodamalis gigas); however, little has been written about how the loss of this megaherbivore may have impacted coastal ecosystem dynamics. Drawing on historical evidence, sea cow biology, kelp forest ecology, and the ecology of extant sirenians, we propose several discrete hypotheses about the effects Steller’s sea cows may have had on kelp forest dynamics of the North Pacific. Location North Pacific Ocean. Time period Pre-1760s. Major taxa studied Steller’s sea cow (Hydrodamalis gigas). Results \& conclusions The evidence we review suggests that Steller’s sea cows exerted substantial direct and indirect influences on kelp forests, likely affecting the physical ecosystem structure, productivity, nutrient cycling, species interactions, and export of nutrients to surrounding ecosystems. This suggests that kelp forest dynamics and resilience were already significantly altered prior to the influence of more recent and well-known stressors, such as industrial fishing and climate change, and illustrates the important ecological roles that are lost with megafaunal extinction.},

  abstract = {Rapid system-wide changes triggered by predators can pose considerable challenges to people. In the Northeast Pacific, the recovery of sea otters Enhydra lutris following their extirpation due to the 18th and 19th century fur trade is driving a social-ecological regime shift with profound implications. While the ecological consequences of this shift are well documented, very little research has examined the conditions that enable or constrain people's ability to adapt to the social, economic and cultural changes that transpire. Through a collaborative partnership and workshops with Indigenous knowledge holders spanning Alaska to British Columbia, along with quantitative and qualitative interviews in two Indigenous communities among the first to experience sea otter recovery, we examined people's perceptions of the social-ecological conditions that affect their ability to adapt to these changes. We found that communities differed in their relative rankings of adaptation-enabling conditions; however, the following four broad strategies were perceived as critical to improving coexistence with sea otters: (a) strengthening Indigenous governance and decision-making authority; (b) promoting adaptive co-management; (c) weaving Indigenous knowledge and Western science into management plans and (d) establishing learning platforms. Both communities also identified that increased livelihood options and financial assistance would not compensate for lost food security. Differences in enabling conditions and attitudes towards sea otters within and between communities can be attributed to the social-ecological and political context in which sea otter recovery occurs. Our study suggests that enhancing Indigenous peoples' ability to adapt to predator-induced regime shifts will require a transformation in current resource governance systems if we are to navigate towards an ecologically sustainable and socially just operating space. Overall, this work highlights the need for more Indigenous authority, knowledge and leadership in addressing predator-induced regime shifts in coupled human-ocean systems.

We conducted annual surveys of rocky reef communities that varied in the recovery of a keystone predator (sea otter, Enhydra lutris) and the mass mortality of a mesopredator (sunflower sea star, Pycnopodia helianthoides) due to an infectious wasting disease. By fitting a population model to empirical data, we show that sea otters had the greatest impact on the mortality of large sea urchins, but that Pycnopodia decline corresponded to a 311\% increase in medium urchins and a 30\% decline in kelp densities. Our results reveal that predator complementarity in size-selective prey consumption strengthens top-down control on urchins, affecting the resilience of alternative reef states by reinforcing the resilience of kelp forests and eroding the resilience of urchin barrens. We reveal previously underappreciated species interactions within a ‘classic’ trophic cascade and regime shift, highlighting the critical role of middle-level predators in mediating rocky reef state transitions.},

Such large-scale changes affect ecosystem functions and can have impacts on societal uses, fisheries resources, and economies. In many large estuaries, anthropogenic CO2-induced acidification is enhanced by strong stratification, long water residence times, eutrophication, and a weak acid–base buffer capacity. In this article, we review how a variety of processes influence aquatic acid–base properties in estuarine waters, including coastal upwelling, river–ocean mixing, air–water gas exchange, biological production and subsequent aerobic and anaerobic respiration, calcium carbonate (CaCO3) dissolution, and benthic inputs. We emphasize the spatial and temporal dynamics of partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2), pH, and calcium carbonate mineral saturation states. Examples from three large estuaries—Chesapeake Bay, the Salish Sea, and Prince William Sound—are used to illustrate how natural and anthropogenic processes and climate change may manifest differently across estuaries, as well as the biological implications of OA on coastal calcifiers.},

Consequently, macroalgae influence the microbial composition of the surrounding water column and biofilms on nearby surfaces. Here, we use manipulative experiments to test the hypotheses that (i) Nereocystis luetkeana and Mastocarpus sp. macroalgae alter the water column microbiota in species-specific manner, that (ii) neighbouring macroalgae alter the bacterial communities on the surface (epibiota) of actively growing Nereocystis luetkeana meristem fragments (NMFs), and that (iii) neighbours alter NMF growth rate. We also assess the impact of laboratory incubation on macroalgal epibiota by comparing each species to wild counterparts. We find strong differences between the Nereocystis and Mastocarpus epibiota that are maintained in the laboratory. Nereocystis and Mastocarpus alter water column bacterial community composition and richness in a species specific manner, but cause only small compositional shifts on NMF surfaces that do not differ by species, and do not change richness. Co-incubation with macroalgae results in significant change in abundance of fivefold more genera in the water column compared to NMF surfaces, although the direction (i.e., enrichment or reduction) of shift is generally consistent between the water and NMF surfaces. Finally, NMFs grew during the experiment, but growth did not depend on the presence or identity of neighbouring macroalgae. Thus, macroalgae exhibit a strong and species-specific influence on the water column microbiota, but a much weaker influence on the epibiota of neighbouring macroalgae. Overall, these results support the idea that macroalgae surfaces are highly selective and demonstrate that modulations of macroalgal microbiota operate within an overarching paradigm of host species specificity.},

We show that the odds of true “pleasure” smiles are greater when hunters pose: (a) with versus without prey, (b) with large versus small prey and, (c) with carnivores versus herbivores (among older men). We emerge with a generalizable achievement-oriented hypothesis to propose that the prospect of displaying large and/or dangerous prey at least in part underlies the behavior of many contemporary hunters. Given that achievement was also likely important among ancestral hunter-gatherers and remains so in contemporary cultural and commercial marketing contexts, management might benefit by increased attention to achievement satisfaction among hunters.},

  abstract = {Mixed-stock fisheries simultaneously exploit populations that may differ in their conservation status, and uncertainty in stock-specific harvest rates can hamper evaluations of recovery prospects for depressed populations. These difficulties are exemplified in the Sockeye Salmon population from the Atnarko watershed, which collapsed in the early 2000s, causing cultural and economic hardship. A recovery plan identified the incidental harvest of Sockeye Salmon by mixed-stock fisheries in the Atnarko as a potential, but poorly understood, impediment to recovery. We reconstructed harvest rates for salmon in Indigenous and commercial fisheries and used an age-structured state-space model of stock–recruit dynamics to predict how a range of future mixed-stock harvest rates would influence recovery. Under recent harvest rates, there is a 50–60\% chance that the population will grow to exceed a recovery goal of 15,000 spawners over the next four generations. Eliminating the harvest of Sockeye Salmon altogether increased predicted recovery prospects to a maximum of 69\%, suggesting that factors other than fisheries are contributing to the lack of recovery (e.g., ocean conditions) and that harvest management alone is unlikely to lead to recovery with a high degree of certainty. We developed a generalized migration, harvest, and catch monitoring simulation model to quantify how different monitoring scenarios might improve estimates for mixed-stock harvest rates. Increasing the number of specimens collected for genetic samples improved the harvest rate estimates for each stock caught in the mixed-stock fisheries, particularly for the smallest stocks, and relative to single sampling events conducted near the peak of the return migration, weekly sampling improved estimates only slightly but provided insurance against missing the peak of the return migration. Our study highlights collaborative research initiated and directed by the Nuxalk Nation to promote the recovery of a depressed stock that is inherent to traditional foods, thereby contributing to a global effort to integrate Indigenous cultural values with biological conservation.},

To adequately estimate the quality of the prey for fish, it is necessary to understand the trophic links at the base of the food-web. Trophic biomarkers (e.g., stable isotopes and fatty acids) are particularly useful to discriminate and quantify food-web relationships. We explored the connections between plankton food-web components, and the seasonal and spatial dynamics of the trophic biomarkers and how this determines the availability of high-quality prey for juvenile Pacific salmon and Pacific herring in the Strait of Georgia, Canada. We demonstrate that the plankton food-web in the region is largely supported by diatom and flagellate production. We also show that spatial differences in terms of energy transfer efficiency exist in the region. Further, we found that the fatty acid composition of the zooplankton varied seasonally, matching a shift from diatom dominated production in the spring to flagellate dominated production in the summer. This seasonal shift conferred a higher nutritional value to zooplankton in the summer, indicating better quality prey for juvenile salmon and herring during this period.},

Species richness and abundance are commonly used to generate complex diversity indices that are dependent on the quality of these estimates. As such, there is a long-standing interest in the development of monitoring techniques, their ability to adequately assess species diversity, and the implications for generated indices. To determine the ability of substratum community assessment methods to capture species diversity, we evaluated four methods: photo quadrat, point intercept, random subsampling, and full quadrat assessments. Species density, abundance, richness, Shannon diversity, and Simpson diversity were then calculated for each method. We then conducted a method validation at a subset of locations to serve as an indication for how well each method captured the totality of the diversity present. Density, richness, Shannon diversity, and Simpson diversity estimates varied between methods, despite assessments occurring at the same locations, with photo quadrats detecting the lowest estimates and full quadrat assessments the highest. Abundance estimates were consistent among methods. Sample-based rarefaction and extrapolation curves indicated that differences between Hill numbers (richness, Shannon diversity, and Simpson diversity) were significant in the majority of cases, and coverage-based rarefaction and extrapolation curves confirmed that these dissimilarities were due to differences between the methods, not the sample completeness. Method validation highlighted the inability of the tested methods to capture the totality of the diversity present, while further supporting the notion of extrapolating abundances. Our results highlight the need for consistency across research methods, the advantages of utilizing multiple diversity indices, and potential concerns and considerations when comparing data from multiple sources.},

  abstract = {Microplastics are ubiquitous across ecosystems, yet the exposure risk to humans is unresolved. Focusing on the American diet, we evaluated the number of microplastic particles in commonly consumed foods in relation to their recommended daily intake. The potential for microplastic inhalation and how the source of drinking water may affect microplastic consumption were also explored. Our analysis used 402 data points from 26 studies, which represents over 3600 processed samples. Evaluating approximately 15\% of Americans’ caloric intake, we estimate that annual microplastics consumption ranges from 39000 to 52000 particles depending on age and sex. These estimates increase to 74000 and 121000 when inhalation is considered. Additionally, individuals who meet their recommended water intake through only bottled sources may be ingesting an additional 90000 microplastics annually, compared to 4000 microplastics for those who consume only tap water. These estimates are subject to large amounts of variation; however, given methodological and data limitations, these values are likely underestimates.},

While the importance of subsidies is known, the role of shellfish, specifically molluscs, as a marine subsidy has not been formally described. Focusing primarily on the Pacific coast of North America, we identify vectors that transport shellfish-derived nutrients into coastal terrestrial environments, including birds, mammals, and over 13 000 yr of marine resource use by people. Evidence from recipient ecosystems suggests shellfish drastically influence soil chemistry, forest productivity and the diversity of primary producers at the regional and landscape level. Responses in higher trophic levels have not yet been investigated, but given documented responses in lower trophic levels, this may be due to a lack of examination. To determine if the processes we describe within the northeast Pacific are pertinent to coastal environments worldwide, we also explore shellfish subsidies globally, with a specific focus on temperate and tropical islands. As shellfish are not as spatially or temporally constrained as other subsidies, our examination suggests our findings are applicable to many other geographical regions along the marine–terrestrial interface.},

Yet, little is known about how aquatic noise affects marine communities. To determine the implications that changes to the soundscape may have on fishes, a meta-analysis was conducted focusing on the ramifications of noise on fish behavior and physiology. Our meta-analysis identified 42 studies that produced 2,354 data points, which in turn indicated that anthropogenic noise negatively affects fish behavior and physiology. The most predominate responses occurred within foraging ability, predation risk, and reproductive success. Additionally, anthropogenic noise was shown to increase the hearing thresholds and cortisol levels of numerous species while tones, biological, and environmental noise were most likely to affect complex movements and swimming abilities. These findings suggest that the majority of fish species are sensitive to changes in the aquatic soundscape, and depending on the noise source, species responses may have extreme and negative fitness consequences. As such, this global synthesis should serve as a warning of the potentially dire consequences facing marine ecosystems if alterations to aquatic soundscapes continue on their current trajectory.},

How omnivores respond, given their multiple trophic interactions, is not well understood. We sampled mice (Peromyscus keeni) and their food sources at five sites on three islands of the Central Coast of British Columbia, Canada, to test predictions regarding variation in the spatial behavior and consumption of marine-subsidized foods among individuals. About 50\% of detections (n = 27 recaptures) occurred at traps closest to shoreline (25 m), with capture frequencies declining significantly inland (up to 200 m). Stable isotope signatures (δ13C and δ15N), particularly δ15N, in plant foods, forest arthropod prey, and mouse feces were significantly enriched near shorelines compared with inland, while δ13C patterns were more variable. Bayesian isotope mixing models applied to isotope values in mouse hair indicated that over one-third (35–37\%) of diet was comprised of beach-dwelling arthropods, a marine-derived food source. Males were more abundant near the shoreline than females and consumed more marine-derived prey, regardless of reproductive status or availability of other food sources. Our results identify how multiple pathways of marine nutrient transfer can subsidize terrestrial omnivores and how subsets of recipient populations can show variation in spatial and dietary response.},

Ingestion and egestion (excretion) of microfibres, and whether these have short-term effects on behaviours such as feeding rate, have yet to be studied in many organisms, especially non-bivalve filter feeders. To determine if a common, filter feeding, intertidal invertebrate can ingest microfibres, we studied the acorn barnacle (Balanus glandula Darwin 1854). We collected B. glandula from four locations near Bamfield, British Columbia, Canada, exposed half of them to a high concentration (\textasciitilde 70,000 microfibres/L) of brightly coloured polyester microfibres for 24~h in unfiltered seawater (while the other half received a non-exposure treatment), and measured the feeding rates of the barnacles before and after the exposure. An average of 1.2~±~1.9 fibres per barnacle were present in the gastrointestinal tracts of the plastic treatment group before depuration, and 0.3~±~0.6 fibres per barnacle were found in the corresponding control group. Prior to depuration, 50\% of the 20 barnacles in the plastic treatment ingested at least one microfibre, while a 15\% ingestion rate was observed in the control group. There was no detectable short-term effect of microfibre ingestion on feeding rate. A 48-h post plastic exposure depuration period was used to evaluate whether microplastics were egested. No difference in egestion was found between those assessed directly after exposure and those that underwent depuration. Furthermore, a low depuration rate of 0.05 microfibres per 48~h suggests that barnacles may require longer than 48~h to egest microfibres. If representative, these results indicate that acorn barnacles ingested few microfibres even when exposed at very high concentrations, which supports the idea that they are at low risk for microplastic contamination and would not be a suitable indicator species.},

Characterizing how microbiota differ across sites with varying environmental conditions and assessing the stability of the microbiota in response to abiotic variation are critical steps towards predicting outcomes of environmental change. Intertidal organisms are valuable study systems because they experience extreme variation in environmental conditions on tractable timescales such as tide cycles and across small spatial gradients in the intertidal zone. Here we show a widespread intertidal macroalgae, Fucus distichus, hosts site-specific microbiota over small (meters to kilometres) spatial scales. We demonstrate stability of site-specific microbial associations by manipulating the host environment and microbial species pool with common garden and reciprocal transplant experiments. We hypothesized that F. distichus microbiota would readily shift to reflect the contemporary environment due to selective filtering by abiotic conditions and/or colonization by microbes from the new environment or nearby hosts. Instead, F. distichus microbiota was stable for days after transplantation in both the laboratory and field. Our findings expand the current understanding of microbiota dynamics on an intertidal foundation species. These results may also point to adaptations for withstanding short-term environmental variation, in hosts and/or microbes, facilitating stable host–microbial associations.},

In this study, we evaluate sea surface pCO2 measurements collected over a 6-year period along a fixed cruise track in the Canada Basin. The measurements show that mean pCO2 levels are significantly higher during low ice years. The pCO2 increase is likely driven by ocean surface heating and uptake of atmospheric CO2 with large interannual variability in the contributions of these processes.

Through the time series, blooms were largely dominated by diatoms, which formed the bulk of annual biomass. Spring diatom bloom timing and magnitude varied widely and appears to have been driven by complex interactions of solar radiation, wind, stratification, and grazing. In turn, post-spring diatom blooms were mostly associated with nutrient renewal to the surface layer as suggested by redundancy analysis (RDA), which showed inverse relationships between diatoms and temperature and stratification. A single non-diatom bloom in July 2016, dominated by the silicoflagellate, Dictyocha sp., was the time series maximum biomass and occurred under warm, stratified conditions and a freshening of the surface layer: The Chemtax dictyochophyte group was positively linked to temperature and stratification through RDA. Outside of bloom conditions, diverse communities emerged with prasinophytes and cryptophytes showing persistent contributions and their highest biomass during summer. Uniquely, these groups often persisted through nutrient renewal and drawdown events typically associated with diatom blooms and suggestive of high grazing pressure and nutrient regeneration. The prevalence of these groups through diverse conditions likely precluded statistical links with environmental drivers. This time series is the first of its kind for the NSoG, creates a baseline for future analyses, and highlights the contributions by small species, particularly prasinophytes, to regional phytoplankton communities.},

Suitability modelling offers a powerful tool for such “biocultural” approaches, but examples remain rare. Led by the Stewardship Authority of the Kitasoo/Xai’xais First Nation in coastal British Columbia, Canada, we developed a locally informed suitability model for a key biocultural indicator, culturally modified trees (CMTs). CMTs are trees bearing evidence of past cultural use that are valued as tangible markers of Indigenous heritage and protected under provincial law. Using a spatial multi-criteria evaluation framework to predict CMT suitability, we developed two cultural predictor variables informed by Kitasoo/Xai’xais cultural expertise and ethnographic data in addition to six biophysical variables derived from LiDAR and photo interpretation data. Both cultural predictor variables were highly influential in our model, revealing that proximity to known habitation sites and accessibility to harvesters (by canoe and foot) more strongly influenced suitability for CMTs compared with site-level conditions. Applying our model to commercial forestry governance, we found that high CMT suitability areas are 51\% greater inside the timber harvesting land base than outside. This work highlights how locally led suitability modelling can improve the social and evidentiary dimensions of environmental management.},

  abstract = {Data and knowledge mobilisation are significant challenges in ecology and resource management, with the journey from data collection through to management action often left incomplete due to difficulties sharing information across diverse and dispersed communities. This disconnect between science and management must be resolved if we are to successfully tackle the increasing impact of human activity on our ecosystems. Across their North Atlantic range, Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) populations are in steep decline in many areas and urgent actions are required to curb this decline. Being commercially important this species has been subject to intense research, but management action often suffers from both a lack of access to this knowledge resource and support for its integration into effective management strategies. To respond to this challenge, the science and management communities must place higher priority on mobilising existing and emerging knowledge sources to inform current and future resource use and mitigation strategies. This approach requires a more complete picture of the current salmon ecology data and knowledge landscape, new mechanisms to enable data mobilisation and re-use, and new research to describe and parameterise the responses of wild populations to habitat changes. Here we present a unique interface for registering and linking data resources relevant to the Atlantic salmon life cycle that can address the data mobilisation aspect of these challenges. The Salmon Ecosystem Data Hub is a salmon-specific metadata catalogue, natively interoperable with many existing data portals, which creates a low resistance pathway to maximise visibility of data relevant to Atlantic salmon. This includes the capacity to annotate datasets with life-stage domains and variable classes, thereby permitting dispersed data to be formally contextualised and integrated to support hypotheses specific to scenario-based modelling and decision-making. The alignment and mobilisation of data within the Salmon Ecosystem Data Hub will help advance the development of appropriate environmentally driven forecast models and an ecosystem-based management approach for Atlantic salmon that optimises future management strategies.},

  abstract = {This article highlights the utility of vibracore technology to sample deep shell midden deposits on the Central Pacific Coast of British Columbia, Canada. Analysis of six core samples and 21 radiocarbon dates revealed that the archaeological deposits extended to a depth of 544 cm below surface and that occupation began approximately 6,000 years ago, continuing into the sixteenth century AD. Zooarchaeological identification of fine screened (2 mm) sediments shows that fish constitute 99.8\% of identified vertebrate fauna, with a focus on herring (Clupea pallasii), salmon (Oncorhynchus sp.), rockfish (Sebastes sp.), and greenling (Hexagrammos sp.), followed by a variety of other fish taxa utilized throughout the occupation of this site. Despite a much smaller examined volume relative to conventional excavation, vibracoring was effective in recovering deep, stratigraphically intact, and adequate samples of zooarchaeological fisheries data as well as a considerable number of stone, bone, and shell artifacts (an estimated 550 artifacts per cubic meter of cultural sediments). These results show a persistent and sustainable ancient fishery through six millennia until the contact period. The field and laboratory methods described are especially conducive to sampling large and deep shell midden deposits repetitively., El presente artículo destaca la utilidad en la aplicación de la tecnología “Vibracore” para muestrear un sitio de “Conchal o Conchero” en la Costa Central del Pacífico de la Columbia Británica, Canadá.

  abstract = {Distribution of Earth’s biomes is structured by the match between climate and plant traits, which in turn shape associated communities and ecosystem processes and services. However, that climate–trait match can be disrupted by historical events, with lasting ecosystem impacts. As Earth’s environment changes faster than at any time in human history, critical questions are whether and how organismal traits and ecosystems can adjust to altered conditions. We quantified the relative importance of current environmental forcing versus evolutionary history in shaping the growth form (stature and biomass) and associated community of eelgrass (Zostera marina), a widespread foundation plant of marine ecosystems along Northern Hemisphere coastlines, which experienced major shifts in distribution and genetic composition during the Pleistocene. We found that eelgrass stature and biomass retain a legacy of the Pleistocene colonization of the Atlantic from the ancestral Pacific range and of more recent within-basin bottlenecks and genetic differentiation. This evolutionary legacy in turn influences the biomass of associated algae and invertebrates that fuel coastal food webs, with effects comparable to or stronger than effects of current environmental forcing. Such historical lags in phenotypic acclimatization may constrain ecosystem adjustments to rapid anthropogenic climate change, thus altering predictions about the future functioning of ecosystems.},

Haíɫzaqv oral history marks this area as a place of origin and longstanding ancestral histories (núyṃ́) have been derived from Núláwitxv. The sea level curve for this area shows that the shoreline was between two and 4\,m lower than today from 14,000 to 10,500 years ago. Intertidal subsurface testing was conducted at EkTb-9 with the hope of discovering archaeological deposits of this age. This resulted in the collection of a varied assemblage of lithics from secondary deposits, representing the products of ancestral labour for the Haíɫzaqv community. The assemblage consists of simple flake and core tools, bifaces, and flakes and cores that generally resemble other early Holocene lithic assemblages from coastal sites in British Columbia. Minimum radiocarbon ages were obtained by dating barnacles found on artifacts, dating this area of the site to at least 9535\,±\,25 B.P. (10,199–9714\,cal\,B.P.), and demonstrating that intertidal lithic scatters can be assigned minimum ages. Critical to our understanding of the intertidal secondary deposits is a detailed knowledge of site formation processes and how these were affected by sea level change, erosion, and beach deposition. The results of this work provide a framework for approaching methodological challenges associated with excavating, dating, and interpreting intertidal archaeological sites.},

Techniques that rely on electron or optical microscopy produce results with varying degrees of success and applicability. Here, a new method is presented and used to differentiate between littoral and eolian sands that were extracted from recently formed landforms, as well as landforms that are from mid to late Holocene in age. The method utilizes a standard optical microscope with a mounted digital camera, paired with freely available software (ImageJ) to characterize grain shape parameters. The method was tested on nearly 6000 sand grains from samples with varied transport histories, and it was found that grain solidity was the most distinguishable characteristic between eolian and littoral samples, differentiating them 86\% of the time for calibration samples. The method was used to correctly identify the mechanism of transport for 76\% of the samples. Patterns in the results indicated that this method could be extended to link potential sediment sources to various depositional basins, and future work includes testing the method in areas with a different mineralogy and/or landscape history.},

We present evidence of a late Pleistocene readvance of Cordilleran ice occurring on the central coast of British Columbia on Calvert Island, between northern Vancouver Island and Haida Gwaii. Evidence is provided by sedimentological and paleoecological information contained in a sedimentary sequence combined with geomorphic mapping of glacial features in the region. Results indicate that a cold climate existed between 15.1 and 14.3 cal ka BP and that ice advanced to, and then retreated from, the western edge of the island between 14.2 and 13.8 cal ka BP. These data provide the first evidence of a major fluctuation in the retreating ice sheet margin in this region and suggest that a cold climate was a major factor in ice readvance. These data contribute to the understanding of past temperature, ice loading and crustal response, the nature of ice margin retreat, and the paleoenvironment of an understudied area of the Pacific Northwest.},

  abstract = {Ocean systems, and the culturally and commercially important fishes that inhabit them, face growing threats. Increasingly, unconventional data sources are being used to inform fisheries research and management for data-poor species. Listed as a species of special concern in Canada, yelloweye rockfish (Sebastes ruberrimus) are vulnerable to exploitation, and have historical and cultural value to Indigenous people. In this study, Indigenous fishers of British Columbia, Canada, were interviewed and asked about observed changes to the body sizes (length) and abundance of this species over the last 60 years, and the factors driving these changes. Their current and historical estimates of size and abundance were compared with current biological survey data. Forty-two semi-directed interviews were carried out and 89\% of respondents observed a decrease in yelloweye rockfish body sizes since the 1980s. The median historical (1950s–1980s) length was 84 cm, compared with the median modern (2010–2015) length of 46 cm. All but one respondent reported substantial decrease in yelloweye rockfish abundance since their earliest fishing experiences (1950s to1980s, depending on participant's age), with a third suggesting the change was most evident in the early 2000s, followed by the 1980s (21\%) and 1990s (17\%). Sizes of modern yelloweye rockfish estimated by participants resembled estimates derived from ecological data recorded concurrently at the study region. This study illustrates a repeatable method for using traditional and local knowledge to extend baselines for data-poor species, and highlights the value of integrating Indigenous knowledge into fisheries research and management.},

International markets can provide higher revenues that benefit small-scale fishing communities but can also drive a decline in fished populations. Collective action in collective organizations such as fishing cooperatives is thought to enhance the sustainability of fished populations. However, our knowledge of how collective action enables fishing cooperatives to achieve positive social-ecological outcomes is dispersed across case studies. Here, we present a quantitative, national-level analysis exploring the relationship between different levels of collective action and social-ecological outcomes. We found that strong collective action in Mexican lobster cooperatives was related to both sustaining their fisheries and benefiting from international trade. In the 15 year study period, lobster cooperatives that demonstrate characteristics associated with strong collective action captured benefits from trade through high catch volumes and revenue. Despite lower (but stable) average prices, the biomass of their lobster populations was not compromised to reap these benefits. Individual case studies previously found that fishing cooperatives can support both positive social and ecological outcomes in small-scale fisheries. Our results confirm these findings at a national level and highlight the importance of strong collective action. Thus, our work contributes to a better understanding of the governance arrangements to promote fishing communities’ welfare and benefits from international trade and, therefore, will be invaluable to advancing small-scale fisheries governance.},

Location Northeast Pacific; 46–60° N and 125–165° W. Time period From 1998 to 2017 (ongoing). Major taxa studied Zooplankton, with a focus on large herbivores. Methods Approximately 280 summer zooplankton samples were analysed for carbon (δ13C) and nitrogen (δ15N) stable isotope (SI) ratios. Environmental conditions experienced by zooplankton organisms were extracted from satellite, in situ sensor and model databases. A generalized additive model approach was used to explain the spatial variability of δ13C and δ15N values and to predict isoscapes. Results Sea surface temperature (SST), sea level anomaly (SLA) and chlorophyll-a concentration emerged as the significant SI predictors. Modelled isoscapes reproduced patterns observed in δ13C and δ15N value distribution, such as a decrease from the coast to offshore. The contribution of eddies in enhancing local production in the open ocean was also well captured by the models. In the central part of the NE Pacific, higher SI values were correlated with higher large copepod biomass measured by the North Pacific Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR) survey. However, in the area off the coast of British Columbia, high δ15N variability appeared to be associated with episodic intrusions of coastal waters, demonstrating that caution is needed when interpreting sharp changes in SI ratios. Main conclusions Although the mechanisms driving SI ratio variability are complex, we demonstrate that a few parameters used as a proxy for some of these major mechanisms are able to produce successful isoscape models. This approach was proved useful to provide a qualitative estimate of secondary production, which can be particularly valuable in a region where few data are available.},

  abstract = {The high seas phase of Pacific salmon life history remains particularly data-limited, and the potential implications of climate impacts on ocean productivity for salmon condition and reproductive success is poorly understood. We used carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes (SI) from salmon scales to reconstruct aspects of the marine environment experienced by Rivers Inlet sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) over the last century (1915–2016). Time series of SI compositions of salmon scales showed a greater variability after 1950, probably linked to more dynamic high seas environmental conditions. However, climate indices (e.g., Pacific Decadal Oscillation, El Niño Southern Oscillation) did not explain the SI variability. We assessed the time series with respect to changes in food web dynamics, including shifting trophic baselines, changes in prey–salmon diet, and changes in salmon foraging location. A significant correlation (r = 0.53) between sea surface temperature and δ13C enabled us to define the area of potential salmon distribution in the open ocean for approximately 9 months prior to sampling. This method shows high potential for stock-specific high seas distribution mapping that could be combined with prey isotope values to inform stock-specific foraging experience.},

  abstract = {Marine carbon dioxide (CO2) system data has been collected from December 2014 to June 2018 in the Northern Salish Sea (NSS; British Columbia, Canada) and consisted of continuous measurements at two sites as well as spatially- and seasonally distributed discrete seawater samples. The array of CO2 observing activities included high-resolution CO2 partial pressure (pCO2) and pHT (total scale) measurements made at the Hakai Institute’s Quadra Island Field Station (QIFS) and from an Environment Canada weather buoy, respectively, as well as discrete seawater measurements of pCO2 and total dissolved inorganic carbon (TCO2) obtained during a number of field campaigns. A relationship between NSS alkalinity and salinity was developed with the discrete datasets and used with the continuous measurements to highly resolve the marine CO2 system. Collectively, these datasets provided insights into the seasonality in this historically under-sampled region and detail the area’s tendency for aragonite saturation state (Ωarag) to be at non-corrosive levels (i.e., Ωarag {$>$} 1) only in the upper water column during spring and summer months. This depth zone and time period of reprieve can be periodically interrupted by strong northwesterly winds that drive short-lived (∼1 week) episodes of high-pCO2, low-pH, and low-Ωarag conditions throughout the region. Interannual variability in summertime conditions was evident and linked to reduced northwesterly winds and increased stratification. Anthropogenic CO2 in NSS surface water was estimated using data from 2017 combined with the global atmospheric CO2 forcing for the period 1765 to 2100, and projected a mean value of 49 ± 5 μmol kg-1 for 2018. The estimated trend in anthropogenic CO2 was further used to assess the evolution of Ωarag and pHT levels in NSS surface water, and revealed that wintertime corrosive Ωarag conditions were likely absent pre-1900. The percent of the year spent above Ωarag = 1 has dropped from ∼98\% in 1900 to ∼60\% by 2018.

  abstract = {Information on marine CO2 system variability has been limited along the northeast Pacific Inside Passage despite the region's rich biodiversity, abundant fisheries, and developing aquaculture industry. Beginning in 2017, the Alaska Marine Highway System M/V Columbia has served as a platform for surface underway data collection while conducting twice weekly ∼1600 km transits between Bellingham, Washington, and Skagway, Alaska. Marine CO2 system patterns were evaluated using measurements made over a 2-year period, which revealed the seasonal cycle as the dominant mode of temporal variability. The amplitude of this signal varied spatially and was modulated by the relative influences of tidal mixing, net community production, and the magnitude and character of freshwater input. Surface water pHT (total hydrogen ion scale) and aragonite saturation state (Ωarag) were determined using carbon dioxide partial pressure (pCO2) data with alkalinity derived from a regional salinity-based relationship, which was evaluated using intervals of discrete seawater samples and underway pH measurements. High-pCO2, low-pHT, and corrosive Ωarag conditions (Ωarag\&lt;1) were seen during winter and within persistent tidal mixing zones, and corrosive Ωarag values were also seen in areas that receive significant glacial melt in summer. Biophysical drivers are shown to dominate pCO2 variability over most of the Inside Passage except in areas highly impacted by glacial melt. pHT and Ωarag extremes were also characterized based on degrees of variability and severity, and regional differences were evident. Computations of the time of detection identified tidal mixing zones as strategic observing sites with relatively short time spans required to capture secular trends in seawater pCO2 equivalent to the contemporary rise in atmospheric CO2. Finally, estimates of anthropogenic CO2 showed notable spatiotemporal variability. Changes in total hydrogen ion content ([H+]T), pHT, and Ωarag over the industrial era and to an atmospheric pCO2 level consistent with a 1.5 ∘C warmer climate were theoretically evaluated. These calculations revealed greater absolute changes in [H+]T and pHT in winter as opposed to larger Ωarag change in summer. The contemporary acidification signal everywhere along the Inside Passage exceeded the global average, with specific areas, namely Johnstone Strait and the Salish Sea, standing out as potential bellwethers for the emergence of biological ocean acidification (OA) impacts. Nearly half of the contemporary acidification signal is expected over the coming 15 years, with an atmospheric CO2 trajectory that continues to be shaped by fossil–fuel development.},

  abstract = {On Quadra Island, west coast Canada, a series of marine terraces formed during a period of rapid marine regression from 200~m to 1~m above modern levels between ca. 14,500 and 12,000 years ago. Within this period of regional marine regression, evidence points to brief periods of sea level stillstand and even marine transgressions. It is hypothesized that during these anomalous periods, global meltwater events created a local signature on the Quadra Island sea level curve by slowing, halting and/or inversing the regional sea level regression trend. This is revealed through identification of high elevation paleoshorelines, landscape terracing and other stranded marine features from LiDAR Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) and subsurface investigation. These paleomarine terraces are believed to have developed during brief marine stillstands, slowstands and minor marine transgressions. Pauses or slowing periods of regression appear to result from global eustatic rise briefly matching or exceeding local isostatic and tectonic uplift. The ages of these terraces, based on local sea level history and radiocarbon dating of some of the raised marine features, match well to the ages of coral-based marine terraces sequences associated with periods of rapid global sea level rise. A number of early post glacial to earliest Holocene archaeological sites are associated with the Quadra marine terraces. These associations suggest an improved approach to location of early archaeological sites dating to times of rapid sea level change.},

  abstract = {A quantification of carbon fluxes in the coastal ocean and across its boundaries with the atmosphere, land, and the open ocean is important for assessing the current state and projecting future trends in ocean carbon uptake and coastal ocean acidification, but this is currently a missing component of global carbon budgeting. This synthesis reviews recent progress in characterizing these carbon fluxes for the North American coastal ocean. Several observing networks and high-resolution regional models are now available. Recent efforts have focused primarily on quantifying the net air–sea exchange of carbon dioxide (CO2). Some studies have estimated other key fluxes, such as the exchange of organic and inorganic carbon between shelves and the open ocean. Available estimates of air–sea CO2 flux, informed by more than a decade of observations, indicate that the North American Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) acts as a sink of 160±80\&thinsp;Tg\&thinsp;C\&thinsp;yr−1, although this flux is not well constrained. The Arctic and sub-Arctic, mid-latitude Atlantic, and mid-latitude Pacific portions of the EEZ account for 104, 62, and −3.7\&thinsp;Tg\&thinsp;C\&thinsp;yr−1, respectively, while making up 51\&thinsp;\%, 25\&thinsp;\%, and 24\&thinsp;\% of the total area, respectively. Combining the net uptake of 160±80\&thinsp;Tg\&thinsp;C\&thinsp;yr−1 with an estimated carbon input from land of 106±30\&thinsp;Tg\&thinsp;C\&thinsp;yr−1 minus an estimated burial of 65±55\&thinsp;Tg\&thinsp;C\&thinsp;yr−1 and an estimated accumulation of dissolved carbon in EEZ waters of 50±25\&thinsp;Tg\&thinsp;C\&thinsp;yr−1 implies a carbon export of 151±105\&thinsp;Tg\&thinsp;C\&thinsp;yr−1 to the open ocean. The increasing concentration of inorganic carbon in coastal and open-ocean waters leads to ocean acidification. As a result, conditions favoring the dissolution of calcium carbonate occur regularly in subsurface coastal waters in the Arctic, which are naturally prone to low pH, and the North Pacific, where upwelling of deep, carbon-rich waters has intensified. Expanded monitoring and extension of existing model capabilities are required to provide more reliable coastal carbon budgets, projections of future states of the coastal ocean, and quantification of anthropogenic carbon contributions.},

Here we report a cross-site analysis of this dataset to gain insight into stream 30Si variability across low-order catchments and to identify potential climate (i.e., runoff), hydrologic, lithologic, and biogeochemical controls on observed stream Si chemical and isotopic signatures. Event-based 30Si exhibit variability both within and across sites (−0.22‰ to +2.27‰) on the scale of what is observed globally in both small catchments and large rivers. Notably, each site shows distinct 30Si signatures that are preserved even after normalization for bedrock composition. Successful characterization of observed cross-site behavior requires the merging of two distinct frameworks in a novel combined model describing both non-uniform fluid transit time distributions and multiple fractionating pathways in application to low-order catchments. The combined model reveals that site-specific architecture (i.e., biogeochemical reaction pathways and hydrologic routing) regulates stream silicon export signatures even when subject to extreme precipitation events.},

  abstract = {Virus particles are highly abundant in seawater and, on average, outnumber microbial cells approximately 10-fold at the surface and 16-fold in deeper waters; yet, this relationship varies across environments. Here, we examine the influence of a suite of environmental variables, including nutrient concentrations, salinity and temperature, on the relationship between the abundances of viruses and prokaryotes over a broad range of spatial and temporal scales, including along a track from the Northwest Atlantic to the Northeast Pacific via the Arctic Ocean, and in the coastal waters of British Columbia, Canada. Models of varying complexity were tested and compared for best fit with the Akaike Information Criterion, and revealed that nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations, as well as prokaryote abundances, either individually or combined, had significant effects on viral abundances in all but hypoxic environments, which were only explained by a combination of physical and chemical factors. Nonetheless, multivariate models of environmental variables showed high explanatory power, matching or surpassing that of prokaryote abundance alone. Incorporating both environmental variables and prokaryote abundances into multivariate models significantly improved the explanatory power of the models, except in hypoxic environments. These findings demonstrate that environmental factors could be as important as, or even more important than, prokaryote abundance in describing viral abundance across wide-ranging marine environments},

  abstract = {Long-term human habitation has transformed the earth's surface. The combination of time and complex human–environment interactions in remote regions of North America has likely resulted in modified landscapes, though we often consider these regions free of human influence due to the absence of industrial development. We examined long-term impacts of human resource-use on British Columbia's coastal rainforest communities. We focused on the region's widespread habitation sites with extensive shell middens to test the legacy of ancient human occupation in present-day plant communities. Ten habitation sites and 10 control sites in similar locales were selected for floristic surveys and soil sampling. We tested whether plant communities at habitation sites reflected a ‘cultural plant-use legacy’, with greater presence of culturally significant plant species, and/or a ‘marine nutrient subsidy legacy’ from human use, with increases in species that prefer nutrient-rich soils. We found that the habitation sites had different plant assemblages than the control sites and were dominated by plants with both higher nutrient requirements and cultural significance. We demonstrate that long-term occupation has led to strong differences in plant community structure between sites, countering the notion that this is a pristine landscape. We emphasize the value of interdisciplinary approaches and considering past human resource-use when examining current plant communities. A plain language summary is available for this article.},

  abstract = {Body size is one of the main regulators of the ecological characteristics of living organisms, including their biogeography. The ‘ubiquity hypothesis’ for microorganisms states that they are widely distributed, if not cosmopolitan, due to their small size that allows passive dispersal, in contrast to large organisms that are limited by geographical barriers in their active dispersal. Such idea, summarized in the tenet ‘Everything is everywhere, but the environment selects’, has driven most of the research in biogeography for microscopic organisms in the last decades, spurring a debate on whether there are fundamental differences in the biogeography of small and large organisms or not (Fenchel \& Finlay 2004; Foissner 2008; Hortal 2011). The strong focus on the ubiquity hypothesis may have been often abused to provide a rationale for otherwise descriptive work on the spatial distribution of microscopic organisms; nevertheless, such focus also provides a framework to understand the mechanisms originating and maintaining biodiversity in space. The reliability of the analyses on unknown and understudied organisms is improving, and Heger et al. (2013) is a splendid example on small unicellular eukaryotes of what should be done to overcome the major problems and ambiguities that heated the debate on the ubiquity hypothesis.},

Alternatively, if heterogeneity effects are positive, then protecting the most heterogeneous habitats may take precedence. We tested for unimodal effects of habitat heterogeneity on the species density (area-corrected richness) of rockfishes (Sebastes spp.): long-lived, benthic fishes vulnerable to overexploitation. Inconsistent with predictions, topographic structural complexity had a strong linear effect on species density; other heterogeneity measures had weaker, positive effects and the only unimodal effect (depth range) was weak. The clear implication is that, to protect the highest density of rockfish species, marine protected areas should include the most topographically complex substrates. Our results can also help refine and test species distribution models needed to inform spatial planning where in situ surveys are lacking. The area–heterogeneity tradeoff generates useful predictions for which support may be context-dependent.},

  abstract = {Accurate assessment of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and their redistribution among the atmosphere, ocean, and terrestrial biosphere in a changing climate – the “global carbon budget” – is important to better understand the global carbon cycle, support the development of climate policies, and project future climate change. Here we describe and synthesize data sets and methodology to quantify the five major components of the global carbon budget and their uncertainties. Fossil CO2 emissions (EFOS) are based on energy statistics and cement production data, while emissions from land-use change (ELUC), mainly deforestation, are based on land use and land-use change data and bookkeeping models. Atmospheric CO2 concentration is measured directly and its growth rate (GATM) is computed from the annual changes in concentration. The ocean CO2 sink (SOCEAN) and terrestrial CO2 sink (SLAND) are estimated with global process models constrained by observations. The resulting carbon budget imbalance (BIM), the difference between the estimated total emissions and the estimated changes in the atmosphere, ocean, and terrestrial biosphere, is a measure of imperfect data and understanding of the contemporary carbon cycle. All uncertainties are reported as ±1σ. For the last decade available (2010–2019), EFOS was 9.6\&thinsp;±\&thinsp;0.5\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr−1 excluding the cement carbonation sink (9.4\&thinsp;±\&thinsp;0.5\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr−1 when the cement carbonation sink is included), and ELUC was 1.6\&thinsp;±\&thinsp;0.7\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr−1. For the same decade, GATM was 5.1\&thinsp;±\&thinsp;0.02\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr−1 (2.4\&thinsp;±\&thinsp;0.01\&thinsp;ppm\&thinsp;yr−1), SOCEAN 2.5\&thinsp;±\&thinsp; 0.6\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr−1, and SLAND 3.4\&thinsp;±\&thinsp;0.9\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr−1, with a budget imbalance BIM of −0.1\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr−1 indicating a near balance between estimated sources and sinks over the last decade. For the year 2019 alone, the growth in EFOS was only about 0.1\&thinsp;\% with fossil emissions increasing to 9.9\&thinsp;±\&thinsp;0.5\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr−1 excluding the cement carbonation sink (9.7\&thinsp;±\&thinsp;0.5\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr−1 when cement carbonation sink is included), and ELUC was 1.8\&thinsp;±\&thinsp;0.7\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr−1, for total anthropogenic CO2 emissions of 11.5\&thinsp;±\&thinsp;0.9\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr−1 (42.2\&thinsp;±\&thinsp;3.3\&thinsp;GtCO2). Also for 2019, GATM was 5.4\&thinsp;±\&thinsp;0.2\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr−1 (2.5\&thinsp;±\&thinsp;0.1\&thinsp;ppm\&thinsp;yr−1), SOCEAN was 2.6\&thinsp;±\&thinsp;0.6\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr−1, and SLAND was 3.1\&thinsp;±\&thinsp;1.2\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr−1, with a BIM of 0.3\&thinsp;GtC. The global atmospheric CO2 concentration reached 409.85\&thinsp;±\&thinsp;0.1\&thinsp;ppm averaged over 2019. Preliminary data for 2020, accounting for the COVID-19-induced changes in emissions, suggest a decrease in EFOS relative to 2019 of about −7\&thinsp;\% (median estimate) based on individual estimates from four studies of −6\&thinsp;\%, −7\&thinsp;\%, −7\&thinsp;\% (−3\&thinsp;\% to −11\&thinsp;\%), and −13\&thinsp;\%. Overall, the mean and trend in the components of the global carbon budget are consistently estimated over the period 1959–2019, but discrepancies of up to 1\&thinsp;GtC\&thinsp;yr−1 persist for the representation of semi-decadal variability in CO2 fluxes. Comparison of estimates from diverse approaches and observations shows (1) no consensus in the mean and trend in land-use change emissions over the last decade, (2) a persistent low agreement between the different methods on the magnitude of the land CO2 flux in the northern extra-tropics, and (3) an apparent discrepancy between the different methods for the ocean sink outside the tropics, particularly in the Southern Ocean. This living data update documents changes in the methods and data sets used in this new global carbon budget and the progress in understanding of the global carbon cycle compared with previous publications of this data set (Friedlingstein et al., 2019; Le Quéré et al., 2018b, a, 2016, 2015b, a, 2014, 2013).

  abstract = {Accurate assessment of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and their redistribution among the atmosphere, ocean, and terrestrial biosphere in a changing climate is critical to better understand the global carbon cycle, support the development of climate policies, and project future climate change. Here we describe and synthesize datasets and methodology to quantify the five major components of the global carbon budget and their uncertainties. Fossil CO2 emissions (EFOS) are based on energy statistics and cement production data, while emissions from land-use change (ELUC), mainly deforestation, are based on land use and land-use change data and bookkeeping models. Atmospheric CO2 concentration is measured directly, and its growth rate (GATM) is computed from the annual changes in concentration. The ocean CO2 sink (SOCEAN) is estimated with global ocean biogeochemistry models and observation-based data products. The terrestrial CO2 sink (SLAND) is estimated with dynamic global vegetation models. The resulting carbon budget imbalance (BIM), the difference between the estimated total emissions and the estimated changes in the atmosphere, ocean, and terrestrial biosphere, is a measure of imperfect data and understanding of the contemporary carbon cycle. All uncertainties are reported as ±1σ. For the first time, an approach is shown to reconcile the difference in our ELUC estimate with the one from national greenhouse gas inventories, supporting the assessment of collective countries' climate progress.  For the year 2020, EFOS declined by 5.4 \% relative to 2019, with fossil emissions at 9.5 ± 0.5 GtC yr−1 (9.3 ± 0.5 GtC yr−1 when the cement carbonation sink is included), and ELUC was 0.9 ± 0.7 GtC yr−1, for a total anthropogenic CO2 emission of 10.2 ± 0.8 GtC yr−1 (37.4 ± 2.9 GtCO2). Also, for 2020, GATM was 5.0 ± 0.2 GtC yr−1 (2.4 ± 0.1 ppm yr−1), SOCEAN was 3.0 ± 0.4 GtC yr−1, and SLAND was 2.9 ± 1 GtC yr−1, with a BIM of −0.8 GtC yr−1. The global atmospheric CO2 concentration averaged over 2020 reached 412.45 ± 0.1 ppm. Preliminary data for 2021 suggest a rebound in EFOS relative to 2020 of +4.8 \% (4.2 \% to 5.4 \%) globally.  Overall, the mean and trend in the components of the global carbon budget are consistently estimated over the period 1959–2020, but discrepancies of up to 1 GtC yr−1 persist for the representation of annual to semi-decadal variability in CO2 fluxes. Comparison of estimates from multiple approaches and observations shows (1) a persistent large uncertainty in the estimate of land-use changes emissions, (2) a low agreement between the different methods on the magnitude of the land CO2 flux in the northern extra-tropics, and (3) a discrepancy between the different methods on the strength of the ocean sink over the last decade. This living data update documents changes in the methods and datasets used in this new global carbon budget and the progress in understanding of the global carbon cycle compared with previous publications of this dataset (Friedlingstein et al., 2020, 2019; Le Quéré et al., 2018b, a, 2016, 2015b, a, 2014, 2013).

  abstract = {Ocean acidification can negatively impact the early life-stages of marine fish, due to energetic costs incurred by the maintenance of acid–base homeostasis, leaving less energy available for growth and development. The embryos of intertidally spawning fishes, such as Pacific herring, are often air exposed for hours. We hypothesized that air exposure would be beneficial to the developing embryo due to a higher oxygen availability (and thus reduced metabolic costs to secure adequate oxygen) and permitting excess CO2 associated with ocean acidification to be off-gassed during emersion. To investigate this, we reared Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii) embryos under three tidal regimes (subtidal: fully immersed, low intertidal: 2\,×\,2~h air exposure, and high intertidal: 5\,+\,9~h air exposure) fully crossed with three aquatic CO2 levels (400, 1500 and 3200 µatm) at a water temperature of 9.5~°C and naturally fluctuating air temperature during air exposure. We measured the effects on embryonic development and hatch, as well as carry-over effects on larval development and survival. Air exposure during embryonic development had significant positive effects on growth, condition and survival in larval Pacific herring, with some interactive effects with CO2. Interestingly, CO2 by itself in the fully immersed treatment had no effect, but had significant interactions with air exposure. Our research suggests that air exposure during low tide can be highly beneficial to intertidally spawning fishes and needs to be taken into account in climate change studies and modeling.},

  abstract = {Pacific salmon stocks are in decline with climate change named as a contributing factor. The North Pacific coast of British Columbia is characterized by strong temporal and spatial heterogeneity in ocean conditions with upwelling events elevating CO2 levels up to 10-fold those of pre-industrial global averages. Early life stages of pink salmon have been shown to be affected by these CO2 levels, and juveniles naturally migrate through regions of high CO2 during the energetically costly phase of smoltification. To investigate the physiological response of out-migrating wild juvenile pink salmon to these naturally occurring elevated CO2 levels, we captured fish in Georgia Strait, British Columbia and transported them to a marine lab (Hakai Institute, Quadra Island) where fish were exposed to one of three CO2 levels (850, 1500 and 2000~μatm CO2) for 2~weeks. At ½, 1 and 2~weeks of exposure, we measured their weight and length to calculate condition factor (Fulton’s K), as well as haematocrit and plasma [Cl−]. At each of these times, two additional stressors were imposed (hypoxia and temperature) to provide further insight into their physiological condition. Juvenile pink salmon were largely robust to elevated CO2 concentrations up to 2000~μatm CO2, with no mortality or change in condition factor over the 2-week exposure duration. After 1~week of exposure, temperature and hypoxia tolerance were significantly reduced in high CO2, an effect that did not persist to 2~weeks of exposure. Haematocrit was increased by 20\% after 2~weeks in the CO2 treatments relative to the initial measurements, while plasma [Cl−] was not significantly different. Taken together, these data indicate that juvenile pink salmon are quite resilient to naturally occurring high CO2 levels during their ocean outmigration.},

We examined body (RNA/DNA, length-weight residuals) and nutritional (fatty acid composition) condition of juvenile sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) in British Columbia, while migrating through oceanographically variable waters. Fish were sampled in the stratified northern Strait of Georgia (NSoG); the highly mixed Johnstone Strait (JS); and the transitional zone of Queen Charlotte Strait (QCS). In 2015, body and nutritional condition were high in the NSoG but rapidly declined to reach lowest levels in JS where prey availability was low, before showing signs of compensatory growth in QCS. In 2016, juvenile salmon had significantly lower condition in the NSoG than in 2015, although zooplankton biomass was similar, condition remained low in JS, and no compensatory growth was observed in QCS. We provide evidence that differences in juvenile salmon condition between the two years were due to changes in the food quality available to juvenile fish. We propose that existing hypotheses about fish survival need to be extended to incorporate food quality in addition to quantity to understand changes in fish condition and survival between years.},

In this paper we explore how archaeologists working on the Northwest Coast of North America have imbricated these two ‘forms of knowing’ to achieve a more complete understanding of history. Indigenous communities on the Northwest Coast have transmitted their complex and dynamic oral narratives across generations for millennia. Indigenous knowledge keepers have upheld rigorous standards of transmission in order to maintain the legitimacy of their oral narratives. Archaeologists have therefore looked to Indigenous oral records as a legitimate and informative source for insight and interpretation. Through the application of archaeological survey and dating methods, archaeologists have been able to temporally and spatially anchor events recounted in oral narratives on the Northwest Coast. In concert, the results have added significant contributions to science, history, jurisprudence and other socio-political pursuits.},

Parasites are one of these biotic influences that are pervasive in natural systems and frequently interact with other stressors. Because they often have cryptic effects on their host organisms, their role in the distribution, abundance, composition, and dynamics of populations, communities, and ecosystems is easy to overlook. However, studies that neglect the role of parasitism may miss or misinterpret organismal responses to environmental change, hampering ecological predictions. We discuss case studies wherein the inclusion of parasite infection status altered the interpretation of ecological outcomes, and offer paths forward to make parasite data acquisition, analysis, and interpretation more accessible to ecologists. Given that parasites are responsive to environmental changes, timely attention to their influence on host responses is critical for accurately predicting future ecological states.},

  abstract = {Coastal oceans play a pivotal role in fisheries production and global biogeochemical cycles, making large-scale monitoring an essential task. The advent of modern remote sensors, such as OLCI (Ocean Land Colour Instrument), on board the Sentinel-3A satellite, has made it possible to obtain oceanic biogeochemical products at higher spatial (300~m) and temporal (daily) resolutions than previously possible. However, validating the Sentinel-3A retrievals for coastal waters is an ongoing effort. Using a regional in situ dataset from British Columbia (BC) and Southeast Alaska (SEA) coastal waters, we evaluated the performance of OLCI Sentinel-3A in retrieving remote-sensing reflectance (Rrs) and biophysical products, including total suspended matter (TSM), chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl-a) and coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM). The OLCI data were processed through a spectral optimization-based algorithm (POLYMER) and a neural net-based (NN) algorithm (C2RCC), including the original (C2RCC v1) and the alternative version (altNN or v2), in which the neural network was trained with extended ranges to cope with larger dynamic range for high backscatter waters. The processors' performance was evaluated through match-up analysis using data from southern BC, as well as expected ranges and seasonal trends for northern BC and SEA. Multimetric statistical analyses demonstrated that POLYMER provided the best overall performance for TSM and Chl-a retrievals, with the Chl-a product improved by the use of the so-called “Case-2” flag. Despite the relative outperformance of POLYMER-derived products, with low systematic biases, the relative percent differences are still high (80–100\%) and should be acknowledged in future analyses when using these data. CDOM, only retrieved here from NN approaches, was better estimated using the alternative version of C2RCC. The best performing approaches were used to evaluate Level-3 composites for northern BC and SEA waters. The observed spatial and seasonal trends compared favourably with those reported in the literature, including highlighting more productive areas (e.g. west coast of Vancouver Island), and the important interactions between riverine systems and adjacent coastal waters (e.g., high TSM and CDOM loads near the Skeena and Nass rivers). This study demonstrated the benefits of OLCI Sentinel-3A to investigate complex coastal ecosystems and provides a robust evaluation of OLCI performance and a framework for future observational and process-oriented studies.},

In two 1-ha floodplain sites in coastal British Columbia, we mapped tree locations, classified gap processes, and described understory vegetation and light transmission on a systematic grid. We used hemispheric photography and spatial interpolation to map understory light, and we examined how environmental heterogeneity affects understory vegetation. Understory light levels are high (overall median 18\% full sun) but vary appreciably over short distances (0.5\% to 19\% full sun over 14 m). Understory composition varies in relation to light transmission, indicating that overstory structure drives fine-scale spatial structure in the understory plant community. Overstory trees appear to create “shade refuges” from competition with dominant shrubs. Shrub cover increases with light and may also play a role in maintaining persistent canopy openings by slowing conifer recruitment. Despite substantial differences in age and development history, each stand exhibits fine-scale spatial coupling of understory light and vegetation. Management practices encouraging structural complexity may accelerate development of similar processes and patterns to restore floodplain function in high-density second growth stands.},

We developed a combined hydro-biogeochemical classification for watersheds draining to the coastal margin of the Northeast Pacific coastal temperate rainforest (1,443,062 km2), including 2,695 small coastal rivers (SCR) and 10 large continental watersheds. We used cluster analysis to group SCR watersheds into 12 types, based on watershed properties. The most important variables for distinguishing SCR watershed types were evapotranspiration, slope, snowfall, and total precipitation. We used both streamflow and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) measurements from rivers (n = 104 and 90 watersheds respectively) to validate the classification. Watershed types corresponded with broad differences in streamflow regime, mean annual runoff, DOC seasonality, and mean DOC concentration. These links between watershed type and river conditions enabled the first region-wide empirical characterization of river hydro-biogeochemistry at the land-sea margin, spanning extensive ungauged and unsampled areas. We found very high annual runoff (mean {$>$} 3,000 mm, n = 10) in three watershed types totaling 59,024 km2 and ranging from heavily glacierized mountain watersheds with high flow in summer to a rain-fed mountain watershed type with high flow in fall-winter. DOC hotspots (mean {$>$} 4 mg L−1, n = 14) were found in three other watershed types (48,557 km2) with perhumid rainforest climates and less-mountainous topography. We described four patterns of DOC seasonality linked to watershed hydrology, with fall-flushing being widespread. Hydro-biogeochemical watershed classification may be useful for other complex regions with sparse observation networks.},

  abstract = {Carbonate chemistry variables such as PCO2, pH, and mineral saturation state (Ω) are commonly thought of as covarying in open-ocean settings but have decoupled over geologic time-scales and among modern dynamic coastal margins and estuaries. Predicting responses of vulnerable coastal organisms to past, present, and future ocean acidification (OA) scenarios requires the empirical identification of organismal sensitivity thresholds to individual carbonate chemistry parameters. Conversely, most OA experiments involve chemistry manipulations that result in covariance of carbonate system variables. We developed the Dynamic Ocean Acidification Manipulation Experimental System (DOAMES)—a feed-forward, flow-through carbonate chemistry control system capable of decoupling PCO2, pH, or Ω by independently manipulating total alkalinity (TAlk) and total inorganic carbon (TCO2). DOAMES proof-of-concept can manipulate source seawater with stable or variable carbonate chemistry and produce experimental treatments with constant and dynamic carbonate chemistry regimes. The combination of dynamic input and output allows for offset treatments that impose a ΔPCO2 on naturally variable conditions. After overcoming several operational challenges, DOAMES is capable of simultaneously generating three different experimental treatments within 1\% ± 1\% of TCO2 and TAlk targets. The achieved precision and accuracy resulted in the successful decoupling of pH and ΩAr in five trials. We tested the viability of sensitive bivalve embryos raised in DOAMES-manipulated seawater and found no difference in development when compared to the control, demonstrating DOAMES suitability for organismal studies. DOAMES provides a novel tool to evaluate organismal effects of exposure to decoupled carbonate system variables and to past, current, and future carbonate chemistry scenarios.},

  abstract = {The environmental consequences of bitumen extraction from oil sands deposits are at the center of North American natural resource and energy policy debate, yet impacts on ocean environments have received little attention. Using a quantitative framework, we identify knowledge gaps and research needs related to the effects of oil sands development on marine biota. Fifteen sources of stress and disturbance – varying greatly in spatial and temporal scale – are generated via two pathways: (1) the coastal storage and oceanic transport of bitumen products, and (2) the contribution of industry-derived greenhouse gases to climate change in the ocean. Of highest research priority are the fate, behavior, and biological effects of bitumen in the ocean. By contrast, climate-change impacts are scientifically well established but not considered in key regulatory processes. Most stressors co-occur and are generated by other industries, yet cumulative effects are so far unaccounted for in decision making associated with new projects. Our synthesis highlights priority research needed to inform future energy development decisions, and opportunities for policy processes to acknowledge the full scope of potential and realized environmental consequences.},

Although a great deal is known about the effects of wind fetch, surface moisture, topographic forcing, and vegetation cover, the role of large woody debris (LWD) as a control on sediment redistribution across beaches is relatively understudied. Pieces of LWD act as non-porous roughness elements that induce secondary flow circulation, thereby creating unique sedimentation patterns that differ markedly from those over a flat beach. Large accumulations of LWD collectively have a bulk porosity that provides substantial sand trapping volume, yet, no studies to date have quantified the effect of LWD on aeolian sand transport. Results from a field study on a macrotidal beach on Calvert Island, British Columbia, Canada, show that the LWD matrix alters the character of the turbulent boundary layer in a way that reduces sediment flux by 99\%. Sand is trapped within the LWD matrix, thereby interrupting sediment delivery from the nearshore to the foredune. As such, LWD has the potential to modulate rates of foredune recovery, growth, and evolution. The relative importance of this effect depends on the density and arrangement of LWD as a fundamental control on aeolian sediment transport, as well as on the magnitude and frequency of events that erode the beach periodically and re-organize the LWD matrix.},

Individual pieces of LWD are non-porous elements that impose bluff body effects and induce secondary flow circulation that varies with size, density, and arrangement. Large assemblages of LWD are common on beaches near forested watersheds and collectively have a degree of porosity that increases aerodynamic roughness in ways that are not fully understood. A field study on a mesotidal sandy beach with a scarped foredune (Calvert Island, British Columbia, Canada) shows that LWD influences flow patterns and turbulence levels. Overall mean and fluctuating energy decline as flow transitions across LWD, while mean energy is converted to turbulent energy. Such flow alterations have implications for sand transport pathways and resulting sedimentation patterns, primarily by inducing deposition within the LWD matrix.},

  abstract = {While considerable evidence exists of biogeographic patterns in the intensity of species interactions, the influence of these patterns on variation in community structure is less clear. Studying how the distributions of traits in communities vary along global gradients can inform how variation in interactions and other factors contribute to the process of community assembly. Using a model selection approach on measures of trait dispersion in crustaceans associated with eelgrass (Zostera marina) spanning 30° of latitude in two oceans, we found that dispersion strongly increased with increasing predation and decreasing latitude. Ocean and epiphyte load appeared as secondary predictors; Pacific communities were more overdispersed while Atlantic communities were more clustered, and increasing epiphytes were associated with increased clustering. By examining how species interactions and environmental filters influence community structure across biogeographic regions, we demonstrate how both latitudinal variation in species interactions and historical contingency shape these responses. Community trait distributions have implications for ecosystem stability and functioning, and integrating large-scale observations of environmental filters, species interactions and traits can help us predict how communities may respond to environmental change.},

During both periods, the spring larval fish assemblages were dominated by pelagic species: Clupea pallasi (Pacific herring), Merluccius productus (Pacific hake), Leuroglossus schmidti (northern smoothtongue) and Theragra chalcogramma (walleye Pollock). The average concentration of Merluccius productus, Theragra chalcogramma, Leuroglossus schmidti, and Sebastes spp. declined between the early 1980s and the late 2000s; in contrast, the absolute concentration and proportion of Pleuronectidae and several demersal fish taxa increased in the spring larval assemblage.

  abstract = {Isotopic studies of archived fish scales have tremendous potential to develop long-term retrospectives that provide important insights into how humans have altered aquatic ecosystems. However, fish specimens in museum archives and other repositories typically date to time periods when the impacts of industrial societies may have already caused profound environmental changes. Archaeological fish bones offer an opportunity to bridge this key temporal gap by providing samples spanning from the recent past to as far back as the Pleistocene. Collagen is the primary protein component of both fish scale and bone, but the comparability of isotopic compositions from these tissues has not been established experimentally. To lay the framework for integrating isotopic datasets from these tissues, we compare δ13C and δ15N of bone and scale collagen, as well as other tissues, from fish with life-time controlled diets. Results show that while there is no difference in δ13C between scale and bone collagen, there may be a very slight but meaningful inter-tissue offset in δ15N ({$<$}0.3‰). We discuss potential sources of δ15N variation in scale and bone collagen measurements. Because there is no difference in scale and bone δ13C, and the observed offset in δ15N is very small (less than analytical uncertainty in many studies), our findings demonstrate that collagen isotopic compositions from these tissues should be directly comparable when integrating datasets from modern and ancient samples to build more powerful, millennium-scale isotopic times series. In linking isotopic compositions of collagen from modern, historical (scales), and archaeological (bones) fish, our findings open the way for more nuanced contextualization of how ecosystems functioned prior to large-scale exploitation and how they have responded to mounting anthropogenic pressures in the intervening centuries.},

  abstract = {Coastal shell midden deposits are a quintessential component of the archaeological record on the Pacific Northwest Coast. Despite their importance in informing the cultural and environmental histories of Indigenous peoples, research on shell middens has largely not sought to address the physical extent of these cultural deposits, which requires estimating shape, depth, and volume. Here, we present a new scalable geospatial model, designed to work with legacy survey data, for estimating midden volumes based on applying a regular geometric solid to sites with known extent and depth. We evaluate the accuracy of this technique using percussion core, total station, and lidar data from eight sites in Tseshaht territory on western Vancouver Island and three sites on the north coast of British Columbia (Canada). As part of the evaluation process of our results, we calculate uncertainty using subsurface core depth data and then compare generalized and modeled midden volume estimates. We demonstrate an accurate general model applied at the regional scale across a systematically surveyed landscape. This work presents the first landscape-scale measure of midden extents and volume within our study area, with relevance to historical ecology and settlement patterns., Los concheros son un componente por excelencia del registro arqueológico en la Costa Noroeste del Pacífico.

We found that the outbreak occurred more rapidly, killed a greater percentage of the population and left fewer survivors in the southern half of the species's range. Pycnopodia now appears to be functionally extinct (greater than 99.2\% declines) from Baja California, Mexico to Cape Flattery, Washington, USA and exhibited severe declines (greater than 87.8\%) from the Salish Sea to the Gulf of Alaska. The importance of temperature in predicting Pycnopodia distribution rose more than fourfold after the outbreak, suggesting latitudinal variation in outbreak severity may stem from an interaction between disease severity and warmer waters. We found no evidence of population recovery in the years since the outbreak. Natural recovery in the southern half of the range is unlikely over the short term. Thus, assisted recovery will probably be required to restore the functional role of this predator on ecologically relevant time scales.},

Estuaries are one of the most productive ecosystems in the world and provide an ideal system to test how communities may be shaped by resource subsidies because they occur at the intersection of marine, freshwater and terrestrial habitats. Here we tested the effects of both terrestrial- and salmon-derived subsidies, in addition to other factors such as habitat area, on the diet (inferred from stable isotopes), abundance and size of a mobile estuarine consumer, the Dungeness crab (Metacarcinus magister). Crab trap surveys encompassed 19 watersheds over two seasons in the central coast of British Columbia, Canada, which spanned natural gradients in estuary size, watershed size, riparian tree composition, and Pacific salmon spawning density. Stable isotope ratios of crab tissue confirmed the predictions that estuarine nutrient regimes can be strongly affected by upstream watershed size, salmon density, and the dominance of nitrogen-fixing red alder (Alnus rubra). There were more crabs in larger estuaries and the largest crabs were found in estuaries below the largest watersheds. The proportional contributions of terrestrial- and salmon-derived subsidies to the diet of Dungeness crabs increased with watershed size and salmon density, respectively. These results confirmed that resource subsidies can constitute large proportions of the Dungeness crab's diet, that crab abundance is determined by habitat size, but that crab size is affected by the magnitude of terrestrial resource influx.},

They receive substantial inputs from adjacent landscapes but the importance of resource subsidies is not well understood. Here, we test hypotheses for the effects of both terrestrial- and salmon-derived resource subsidies on the diet (inferred from stable isotopes of muscle tissue), size and percent nitrogen of the soft-shell clam (Mya arenaria), a sedentary estuarine consumer. We examine how these relationships shift across natural gradients among 14 estuaries that vary in upstream watershed size and salmon density on the central coast of British Columbia, Canada. We also test how assimilation and response to subsidies vary at smaller spatial scales within estuaries. The depletion and enrichment of stable isotope ratios in soft-shell clam muscle tissue correlated with increasing upstream watershed size and salmon density, respectively. The effects of terrestrial- and salmon-derived subsidies were also strongest at locations near stream outlets. When we controlled for age of individual clams, there were larger individuals with higher percent nitrogen content in estuaries below larger watersheds, though this effect was limited to the depositional zones below river mouths. Pink salmon exhibited a stronger effect on isotope ratios of clams than chum salmon, which could reflect increased habitat overlap as spawning pink salmon concentrate in lower stream reaches, closer to intertidal clam beds. However, there were smaller clams in estuaries that had higher upstream pink salmon densities, possibly due to differences in habitat requirements. Our study highlights the importance of upstream resource subsidies to this bivalve species, but that individual responses to subsidies can vary at smaller scales within estuaries.},

  abstract = {Nutrient subsidies and physical disturbance from migrating species can have strong impacts on primary producers. In the north Pacific, adult salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) transport marine-derived nutrients back to freshwater streams and can also significantly disrupt the substratum during spawning events. We tested for effects of spawning pink (O. gorbuscha) and chum (O. keta) salmon on stream biofilm. Biofilm is a mix of algae, fungi and bacteria that provides food and habitat and forms the base of these aquatic food webs. We collected rock biofilm samples to compare stable isotopes and biomass prior to and following peak salmon spawning in 16 catchments on the central coast of British Columbia, Canada. We conducted two separate analyses. The first was a within-stream comparison, which focused on 5 catchments that had a barrier to pink and chum salmon migration. The second was an among-stream analysis that included all 16 catchments and explicitly considered biotic and abiotic factors, in addition to salmon density, known to influence biofilm growth and isotope ratios. Salmon density proved to be the best predictor of biofilm δ15N. Biofilm δ13C was best predicted by salmon density and catchment size. While spring chlorophyll a increased with mean salmon density, it was on average lower during spawning in the autumn, probably due to physical disturbance from spawning salmon. These results show that of the several variables considered to affect biofilm isotopes and biomass, salmon density and catchment size are among the most influential in coastal streams where salmon spawn.},

  abstract = {Resource flows and disturbance from species migrations can alter the productivity, structure and function of an ecosystem. Annual mass migrations of Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) to coastal watersheds import vast quantities of potentially limiting nutrients that have been shown to increase primary and secondary productivity in streams and lakes. Substrate disturbance during spawning can also export nutrients and reduce primary and secondary production. Here we study the impacts of these dual roles of salmon on stream invertebrates. We collected benthic macroinvertebrates in 15 streams prior to and following peak salmon spawning on British Columbia's central coast. Along with other habitat measurements including stream water chemistry, temperature, and watershed size, we investigated the effects of salmon on invertebrate δ15N, δ13C and biomass density (mg/m2) among 15 streams and within 5 streams, upstream and downstream of barriers to spawning salmon. We found that stream invertebrates assimilate salmon-derived nutrients in proportion to availability but invertebrate biomass density declines in both seasons with increasing salmon density. Benthic disturbance appears to be the cause of this decline in the fall, but the decline in the spring may be due to the slow recovery of invertebrates from substrate disturbance the previous fall or salmon nutrients may be indirectly driving declines in spring invertebrate biomass by subsidizing other trophic levels and eliciting a trophic cascade.},

  abstract = {The carbonate system in two contrasting fjords, Rivers Inlet and Bute Inlet, on the coast of British Columbia, Canada, was evaluated to characterize the mechanisms driving carbonate chemistry dynamics and assess the impact of anthropogenic carbon. Differences in the character of deep water exchange between these fjords were inferred from their degree of exposure to continental shelf water and their salinity relationships with total alkalinity and total dissolved inorganic carbon, which determined seawater buffering capacity. Seawater buffering capacity differed between fjords and resulted in distinct carbonate system characteristics with implications on calcium carbonate saturation states and sensitivity to increasing anthropogenic carbon inputs. Saturation states of both aragonite and calcite mineral phases of calcium carbonate were seasonally at or below saturation throughout the entire water column in Bute Inlet, while only aragonite was seasonally under-saturated in portions of the water column in Rivers Inlet. The mean annual saturation states of aragonite in Rivers Inlet and calcite in Bute Inlet deep water layers have declined to below saturation within the last several decades due to anthropogenic carbon accumulation, and similar declines to undersaturation are projected in their surface layers as anthropogenic carbon continues to accumulate. This study demonstrates that the degree of fjord water exposure to open shelf water influences the uptake and sensitivity to anthropogenic carbon through processes affecting seawater buffering capacity, and that reduced uptake but greater sensitivity occurs where distance to ocean source waters and freshwater dilution are greater.},

  abstract = {Genetic monitoring using noninvasive samples provides a complement or alternative to traditional population monitoring methods. However, next-generation sequencing approaches to monitoring typically require high quality DNA and the use of noninvasive samples (e.g., scat) is often challenged by poor DNA quality and contamination by nontarget species. One promising solution is a highly multiplexed sequencing approach called genotyping-in-thousands by sequencing (GT-seq), which can enable cost-efficient genomics-based monitoring for populations based on noninvasively collected samples. Here, we develop and validate a GT-seq panel of 324 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) optimized for genotyping of polar bears based on DNA from noninvasively collected faecal samples. We demonstrate (1) successful GT-seq genotyping of DNA from a range of sample sources, including successful genotyping ({$>$}50\% loci) of 62.9\% of noninvasively collected faecal samples determined to contain polar bear DNA; and (2) that we can reliably differentiate individuals, ascertain sex, assess relatedness, and resolve population structure of Canadian polar bear subpopulations based on a GT-seq panel of 324 SNPs. Our GT-seq data reveal spatial-genetic patterns similar to previous polar bear studies but at lesser cost per sample and through use of noninvasively collected samples, indicating the potential of this approach for population monitoring. This GT-seq panel provides the foundation for a noninvasive toolkit for polar bear monitoring and can contribute to community-based programmes – a framework which may serve as a model for wildlife conservation and management for species worldwide.},

  abstract = {This paper examines the multi-decadal evolution of a foredune and backshore river complex on a wave-dominated, drift-aligned coast at Wickaninnish Bay on southwestern Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada. Local shoreline positions are generally prograding seaward as fast as +1.46ma−1 in response to rapid regional tectonic uplift and positive onshore sediment budgets. The northern end of the foredune system has extended rapidly alongshore in response to net northward littoral drift. Despite these net accretional responses, the beach–dune system experiences relatively frequent (return interval \textasciitilde 1.53years) erosive events when total water levels exceed a local erosional threshold elevation of 5.5m above regional chart datum. Geomorphic recovery of the beach–dune system from erosive events is usually rapid (i.e., within a year) by way of high onshore sand transport and aeolian delivery to the upper beach. This response is complicated locally, however, by the influence of a backshore river that alters spatial–temporal patterns of both intertidal and supratidal erosion and deposition. Historic landscape changes and rates of shoreline positional change are derived from several years of aerial photography (1973, 1996, 2007, 2009, 2012) using the USGS Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS). Significant volumetric changes are also estimated from aerial LiDAR-derived DEMs in 2005, 2009 and 2012, and related morphodynamics are interpreted using a statistically constrained geomorphic change detection method. Results suggest that supratidal bar development, overwash deposition and aeolian deposition on a low-lying supratidal platform, combined with alongshore extension of the foredune complex, is forcing Sandhill Creek to migrate northward in the direction of beach drift. In response, the river actively erodes (−1.24ma−1) a bluff system landward of the channel, which generates substantial sediment volumes (−0.137m3m−2a−1) that feed a large intertidal braided channel and delta system. These local responses provide context for a conceptual model of the evolution of a wave-dominated, drift-aligned beach–foredune system that interacts with a backshore river. This model may provide useful information to local park managers as erosion and sedimentation hazards threaten visitor safety and park infrastructure.},

Here, high-throughput environmental sequencing was used to characterize the diversity and community structure of litter- and moss-associated protists along a gradient of soil drainage and forest primary productivity in a temperate rainforest in British Columbia. We identified 3262 distinct protist OTUs from 36 sites. Protists were strongly structured along the landscape gradient, with a significant increase in alpha diversity from the blanket bog ecosystem to the zonal forest ecosystem. Among all investigated environmental variables, calcium content was the most strongly associated with the community composition of protists, but substrate composition, plant cover and other edaphic factors were also significantly correlated with these communities. Furthermore, a detailed phylogenetic analysis of unicellular opisthokonts identified OTUs covering most lineages, including novel OTUs branching with Discicristoidea, the sister group of Fungi, and with Filasterea, one of the closest unicellular relatives to animals. Altogether, this study provides unprecedented insight into the community composition of moss- and litter-associated protists.},

We used mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COI) gene sequences to investigate the genetic diversity and phylogeography of the testate amoeba morphospecies Hyalosphenia papilio in 42 Sphagnum (moss)-dominated peatlands in North America, Europe and Asia. Based on ≥1\% sequence divergence threshold, our results from single-cell PCRs of 301 individuals revealed 12 different genetic lineages and both the general mixed Yule-coalescent (GMYC) model and the automatic barcode gap discovery (ABGD) methods largely support the hypothesis that these 12 H. papilio lineages correspond to evolutionary independent units (i.e. cryptic species). Our data also showed a high degree of genetic heterogeneity within different geographical regions. Furthermore, we used variation partitioning based on partial redundancy analyses (pRDA) to evaluate the contributions of climate and dispersal limitations on the distribution patterns of the different genetic lineages. The largest fraction of the variation in genetic lineage distribution was attributed to purely climatic factors (21\%), followed by the joint effect of spatial and bioclimatic factors (13\%), and a purely spatial effect (3\%). Therefore, these data suggest that the distribution patterns of H. papilio genetic lineages in the Northern Hemisphere are more influenced by climatic conditions than by dispersal limitations.},

Likewise, latitudinal patterns of tolerance traits have rarely been studied, yet they can be a critical component of plant defence. Therefore, the aim of our study was to examine latitudinal variation in the production of tolerance and resistance traits against herbivory along a latitudinal range and a natural gradient of resource availability from upwelling conditions. Location North America (Canada, USA, Mexico). Time period Summer months of 2015. Major taxa used The seagrass Zostera marina. Methods We conducted experiments simulating macroherbivore (e.g., bird, fish) damage on the seagrass Z. marina at 10 sites across the Eastern Pacific coast (Canada–Mexico) and Quebec and analysed several traits related to resistance and tolerance strategies against herbivory. In addition, we examined the effects of potential seagrass changes in defence strategies by performing a series of feeding experiments with mesoherbivores in a subset of sites. Results We found that eelgrass resistance defences did not follow a linear latitudinal pattern but rather followed a bell-shaped curve which correlated with bottom-up control. In sites with higher nutrient availability, plants allocated resources to tolerance strategies and had lower resistance traits. Furthermore, seagrasses did not respond linearly to increased herbivory pressure; while they tolerated moderate levels of herbivory, they underwent a significant reduction in tolerance and resistance under high herbivory levels, which also made them more susceptible to consumers in feeding experiments. Main conclusions Our results highlight the importance that nutrient availability has in shaping latitudinal patterns of plant defence against herbivory and show how these defences may not respond linearly to increased herbivory pressure in seagrasses.},

  abstract = {Although the dispersal ability of kinorhynchs is known to be limited, the distribution of certain kinorhynch species appears to extend over vast geographical areas. Combining molecular phylogenetic data with biogeographical investigations can test this paradox by discerning cryptic species with restricted distributions from species with potentially large geographical distributions. In this paper, we (1) redescribe two species of kinorhynchs (Echinoderes ohtsukai and E. kozloffi) found in the northeastern Pacific Ocean using molecular and morphological data and (2) provide the first evidence for a disjunct geographical distribution in kinorhynchs that is consistent with the introduction of an invasive species. Although we collected E. ohtsukai from the northeastern Pacific Ocean (British Columbia, Canada), this species was originally described from Japan. We demonstrated that specimens of E. ohtsukai collected from Japan and British Columbia have identical DNA sequences for the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COI) gene. These results are most consistent with a recent introduction of this species into one of the habitats on the opposite side of the Pacific Ocean through human-mediated dispersal.},

We review potential ecosystem drivers of sea otter foraging in CA and BC seagrass beds, including the role of coastline complexity and environmental stress on sea otter effects. In BC, we find greater species richness across seagrass trophic assemblages. Furthermore, Cancer spp. crabs, an important link in the seagrass trophic cascade observed in CA, are less common. Additionally, the more recent reintroduction of sea otters, more complex coastline, and reduced environmental stress in BC seagrass habitats supports the hypotheses that sea otter foraging pressure is currently reduced there. In order to manage the ecosystem features that lead to regional differences in top predator effects in seagrass communities, we review our findings, their spatial and temporal constraints, and present a social-ecological framework for future research.},

Although dogs depended on human communities for care and provisioning, archaeologists lack information about the specific foods dogs consumed. Previous research has used stable isotope analysis of dog diets for insight into human subsistence (‘canine surrogacy’ model) and identified considerable use of marine resources. Here, we use zooarchaeological data to develop and apply a Bayesian mixing model (MixSIAR) to estimate dietary composition from 14 domestic dogs and 13 potential prey taxa from four archaeological sites (2,900–300 BP) in Tseshaht First Nation territory on western Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada. Two candidate models that best match zooarchaeological data indicate dogs predominantly consumed salmon and forage fish (35–65\%), followed by nearshore fish (4–40\%), and marine mammals (2–30\%). We compared these isotopic data to dogs across the Northwest Coast, which indicated a pronounced marine diet for Tseshaht dogs and, presumably, their human providers. These results are broadly consistent with the canine surrogacy model as well as help illuminate human participation in pre-industrial marine food webs and the long-term role of fisheries in Indigenous economies and lifeways.},

  abstract = {Climate change is altering the distribution and composition of marine fish populations globally, which presents substantial risks to the social and economic well-being of humanity. While deriving long-term climatic baselines is an essential step for detecting and attributing the magnitude of climate change and its impacts, these baselines tend to be limited to historical datasets and palaeoecological sediment records. Here, we develop a method for estimating the ‘ancient Mean Temperature of the Catch’ (aMTC) using Indigenous fisheries catch records from two archaeological sites in the northeast Pacific. Despite different catch compositions, we observe an increase in aMTC over a 5,000-year period at two contemporaneously occupied archaeological sites in southwestern British Columbia, Canada. We document cooler catches from 5,000 to 3,000~cal~yr BP and comparatively warmer catches from 1,800~to~250~cal~yr BP. These warmer temperatures are broadly consistent with palaeoceanographic sea surface temperature proxies from British Columbia and Alaska. Because this method requires converting measures of fish bones into estimates of fish size structure, abundance, biomass, and finally aMTC, opportunities exist to account for both variation and uncertainty at every step. Nevertheless, given that preindustrial fisheries data are ubiquitous in coastal archaeological sites, this method has the potential to be applied globally to broaden the temporal and geographic scale of ocean temperature baselines.},

Secondary loss of genicula has occurred three times in the subfamily Corallinoideae, once to generate the entirely nongeniculate genus Crusticorallina and twice in the now morphologically heterotypic Bossiella.

Fortunately, DNA sequences provide an additional basis for comparison, independent of morphology. Most importantly, by obtaining DNA sequences from historical type specimens, we are now able to unequivocally match species names to genetic groups, often with surprising results. Methods: We used an integrative taxonomic approach to identify and describe Northeast Pacific pinnately branched species in the red algal coralline genus Bossiella, for which traditional taxonomy recognized only one species, the generitype, Bossiella plumosa. We analyzed DNA sequences from historical type specimens and modern topotype specimens to assign species names and to identify genetic groups that were different and that required new names. Our molecular taxonomic assessment was followed by a detailed morphometric analysis of each species. KEY RESULTS: Our study of B. plumosa revealed seven pinnately branched Bossiella species. Three species, B. frondescens, B. frondifera, and B. plumosa, were assigned names based on sequences from type specimens. The remaining four species, B. hakaiensis, B. manzae, B. reptans, and B. montereyensis, were described as new to science. In most cases, there was significant overlap of morphological characteristics among species. CONCLUSIONS: This study underscores the pitfalls of relying upon morpho-anatomy alone to distinguish species and highlights our likely underestimation of species worldwide. Our integrative taxonomic approach can serve as a model for resolving the taxonomy of other plant and algal genera.},

  abstract = {Understanding how trophic dynamics drive variation in biodiversity is essential for predicting the outcomes of trophic downgrading across the world’s ecosystems. However, assessing the biodiversity of morphologically cryptic lineages can be problematic, yet may be crucial to understanding ecological patterns. Shifts in keystone predation that favor increases in herbivore abundance tend to have negative consequences for the biodiversity of primary producers. However, in nearshore ecosystems, coralline algal cover increases when herbivory is intense, suggesting that corallines may uniquely benefit from trophic downgrading. Because many coralline algal species are morphologically cryptic and their diversity has been globally underestimated, increasing the resolution at which we distinguish species could dramatically alter our conclusions about the consequences of trophic dynamics for this group. In this study, we used DNA barcoding to compare the diversity and composition of cryptic coralline algal assemblages at sites that differ in urchin biomass and keystone predation by sea otters. We show that while coralline cover is greater in urchin-dominated sites (or “barrens”), which are subject to intense grazing, coralline assemblages in these urchin barrens are significantly less diverse than in kelp forests and are dominated by only 1 or 2 species. These findings clarify how food web structure relates to coralline community composition and reconcile patterns of total coralline cover with the widely documented pattern that keystone predation promotes biodiversity. Shifts in coralline diversity and distribution associated with transitions from kelp forests to urchin barrens could have ecosystem-level effects that would be missed by ignoring cryptic species’ identities.},

While reconstructing historical fire regimes typically requires dendrochronological records from fire-scarred trees or stratigraphically preserved lake sediment data, this type of information is virtually non-existent in this region. To describe the long-term fire history of a site on the central coast of British Columbia, Canada, we radiocarbon-dated 52 pieces of charcoal. Charcoal ages ranged from 12,670 to 70 yr BP. Fires occurred regularly since 12,670 yr BP, with the exception of a distinct fire-free period at 7500–5500 yr BP. Time since fire (TSF) estimates from soil charcoal and fire-scarred trees ranged from 12,670 to 100 yr BP (median = 327 yr), and 70\% of the sites examined had burned within the past 1000 yr. An increase in fire frequency in the late Holocene is consistent with the widely held hypothesis that anthropogenic fires were common across the PNW. We evaluate TSF distributions and discuss the difficulties in assigning actual fire dates from charcoal fragments with large inbuilt ages in a coastal temperate rain forest setting. We determine that a comprehensive approach using soil charcoal and fire scar analyses is necessary to reconstruct general trends in fire activity throughout the Holocene in this region.},

Unfortunately, the displacement of Indigenous peoples and place-based societies that rely on and routinely practice fire stewardship has resulted in significant declines in biodiversity and the functional roles of people in shaping pyrodiverse systems [R. Bliege Bird et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 117, 12904–12914 (2020)]. With the aim of assessing the impacts of Indigenous fire stewardship on biodiversity and species function across Earth’s major terrestrial biomes, we conducted a review of relevant primary data papers published from 1900 to present. We examined how the frequency, seasonality, and severity of human-ignited fires can improve or reduce reported metrics of biodiversity and habitat heterogeneity as well as changes to species composition across a range of taxa and spatial and temporal scales. A total of 79\% of applicable studies reported increases in biodiversity as a result of fire stewardship, and 63\% concluded that habitat heterogeneity was increased by the use of fire. All studies reported that fire stewardship occurred outside of the window of uncontrollable fire activity, and plants (woody and nonwoody vegetation) were the most intensively studied life forms. Three studies reported declines in biodiversity associated with increases in the use of high-severity fire as a result of the disruption of Indigenous-controlled fire regimes with the onset of colonization. Supporting Indigenous-led fire stewardship can assist with reviving important cultural practices while protecting human communities from increasingly severe wildfires, enhancing biodiversity, and increasing ecosystem heterogeneity.},

  abstract = {Aim Few long-term fire histories have been reconstructed in coastal temperate rain forests, and little is known regarding the spatial and temporal characteristics of lightning and human ignitions. We use a multidisciplinary approach to assess the impact, scale and ecological legacies of historic fires. Location We focus on perhumid temperate rain forests located on the central coast of British Columbia, Canada. Methods We reconstructed 700 years of temporal and spatial aspects of fire activity with 30 plots on Hecate Island using fire scars and forest-stand establishment. We then conducted a paired study of 20 former indigenous habitation and control sites on 15 islands to relate fire activity to patterns of human settlement. We mapped 15 years of lightning strike densities and use mixed-effects modelling to assess whether fire activity predicted the distribution and abundance of traditional plants. Results Sixteen low- and mixed-severity fires were recorded from 1376 to 1893. The abundance of traditional plants and the density of western redcedar trees were best predicted by the location of former habitation sites and shorter mean fire intervals. Lightning is too rare to explain the pattern of fire activity in the study area. No fire activity was detected after 1893, coinciding with the relocation of indigenous groups from the study area. Main conclusions Fire was strongly associated with former indigenous habitation sites during the periods of occupation. People likely utilized fire as a tool for resource management to influence the densities of specific plants by creating mosaics of vegetation in different stages of succession. By assessing the ecological impacts of historic fire events, we gain a better understanding of the abrupt changes that occurred in the 20th century. Our ability to understand present-day temperate rain forest ecosystems may be compromised if we underestimate the role of humans in driving historic fire activity.},

  abstract = {Vegetation succession following fire disturbances has long been of interest in ecology, but the evolution of landscape pattern and structure following low-severity ground fires is poorly understood. In coastal temperate rainforest ecosystems historic fire disturbances are not well documented and time since the most recent fire is largely unknown. We sampled 6000 tree cores from 27 forest plots that burned 124 years ago and 11 plots with no recent history of fire (within the last 1000 years) to understand the legacies of fire on forest stand structure in a British Columbia high-latitude coastal temperate rainforest. We assessed the timing and spatial extent of historic fires with a 700 year fire history reconstruction built from fire scars, and applied light detection and ranging (LiDAR) to ground-truth plot-level measurements. We sampled an additional 32 plots with known fire histories to validate the ability of LiDAR to detect and characterize historic fire legacies. In total, we sampled 70 plots for stem density, stand structure, and stand composition. Trees in burned plots were significantly taller, and the mean stem density was less than half that of unburned plots despite 124 \,years since the most recent fire. LiDAR analyses had similar results and also showed that burned plots had lower canopy cover and greater canopy complexity. Field-based measurements are still required to resolve differences in community structure and composition in our temperate rainforest study area. However, LiDAR may be an important tool to bridge the spatial information offered by plot-level measurements to larger area characterizations in the future. Our comparative analyses provide an improved understanding of fire legacies and temperate rainforest structure, which increases our ability to detect fire disturbances in heterogeneous forests and is important for forest resource management and conservation.},

  abstract = {Fire exclusion and suppression has altered the composition and structure of Garry oak and associated ecosystems in British Columbia. The absence of frequent low severity ground fires has been one of the main contributors to dense patches of non-native grasses, shrubs, and encroaching Douglas-fir trees in historical Garry oak dominated meadows. This case study uses remote sensing and dendrochronology to reconstruct the stand dynamics and long-term fire history of a Garry oak meadow situated within Helliwell Provincial Park located on Hornby Island, British Columbia. The Garry oak habitat in Helliwell Park has decreased by 50\% since 1950 due to conifer encroachment. Lower densities and mortalities of Garry oak trees were associated with the presence of overstory Douglas-fir trees. To slow conifer encroachment into the remaining Garry oak meadows, we recommend that mechanical thinning of Douglas-fir be followed by a prescribed burning program. Reintroducing fire to Garry oak ecosystems can restore and maintain populations of plants, mammals, and insects that rely on these fire resilient habitats.},

We reconstructed fire activity with a ca 700-year fire history derived from fire scars and stand establishment from 30 sites in a very wet (up to 4000\hspace{0.25em}mm annual precipitation) temperate rainforest in coastal British Columbia, Canada. Drought and warmer temperatures in the year prior were positively associated with fire events though there was little coherence of climate indices on the years of fires. At the decadal scale, fires were more likely to occur after positive El Niño-Southern Oscillation and Pacific Decadal Oscillation phases and exhibited 30-year periods of synchrony with the negative phase of the Arctic Oscillation. Fire frequency was significantly inversely correlated with the distance from former Indigenous habitation sites and fires ceased following cultural disorganization caused by disease and other European impacts in the late nineteenth century. Indigenous people were likely to have been the primary ignition source in this and many coastal temperate rainforest settings. These data are directly relevant to contemporary forest management and discredit the myth of coastal temperate rainforests as pristine landscapes.},

Shellfish aquaculture in British Columbia (BC), Canada, showcases many of these issues. This review explores key socio-economic and ecological considerations for future growth of shellfish aquaculture on the central and north coast of BC, with implications for the continuing global expansion of the industry. Interactions among shellfish aquaculture, coastal groups, existing industries, and First Nations, as well as considerations under changing oceanic conditions are investigated. Expansion of shellfish aquaculture on the central and north coast of BC will need to be socially, environmentally, and economically sustainable. The results of this review strongly indicate that shellfish aquaculture should be incorporated in marine planning initiatives and developed in consideration of local ecological, environmental, economic, and social context.},

Yet, owing to the scarcity of constrained mass loss observations, glacier evolution during the satellite era is known only partially, as a geographic and temporal patchwork4,5. Here we reveal the accelerated, albeit contrasting, patterns of glacier mass loss during the early twenty-first century. Using largely untapped satellite archives, we chart surface elevation changes at a high spatiotemporal resolution over all of Earth’s glaciers. We extensively validate our estimates against independent, high-precision measurements and present a globally complete and consistent estimate of glacier mass change. We show that during 2000–2019, glaciers lost a mass of 267~±~16 gigatonnes per year, equivalent to 21~±~3 per cent of the observed sea-level rise6. We identify a mass loss acceleration of 48~±~16 gigatonnes per year per decade, explaining 6 to 19 per cent of the observed acceleration of sea-level rise. Particularly, thinning rates of glaciers outside ice sheet peripheries doubled over the past two decades. Glaciers currently lose more mass, and at similar or larger acceleration rates, than the Greenland or Antarctic ice sheets taken separately7–9. By uncovering the patterns of mass change in many regions, we find contrasting glacier fluctuations that agree with the decadal variability in precipitation and temperature. These include a North Atlantic anomaly of decelerated mass loss, a strongly accelerated loss from northwestern American glaciers, and the apparent end of the Karakoram anomaly of mass gain10. We anticipate our highly resolved estimates to advance the understanding of drivers that govern the distribution of glacier change, and to extend our capabilities of predicting these changes at all scales. Predictions robustly benchmarked against observations are critically needed to design adaptive policies for the local- and regional-scale management of water resources and cryospheric risks, as well as for the global-scale mitigation of sea-level rise.},

  abstract = {Anthropogenic activities have led to the biotic homogenization of many ecological communities, yet in coastal systems this phenomenon remains understudied. In particular, activities that locally affect marine habitat-forming foundation species may perturb habitat and promote species with generalist, opportunistic traits, in turn affecting spatial patterns of biodiversity. Here, we quantified fish diversity in seagrass communities across 89 sites spanning 6° latitude along the Pacific coast of Canada, to test the hypothesis that anthropogenic disturbances homogenize (i.e., lower beta-diversity) assemblages within coastal ecosystems. We test for patterns of biotic homogenization at sites within different anthropogenic disturbance categories (low, medium, and high) at two spatial scales (within and across regions) using both abundance- and incidence-based beta-diversity metrics. Our models provide clear evidence that fish communities in high anthropogenic disturbance seagrass areas are homogenized relative to those in low disturbance areas. These results were consistent across within-region comparisons using abundance- and incidence-based measures of beta-diversity, and in across-region comparisons using incidence-based measures. Physical and biotic characteristics of seagrass meadows also influenced fish beta-diversity. Biotic habitat characteristics including seagrass biomass and shoot density were more differentiated among high disturbance sites, potentially indicative of a perturbed environment. Indicator species and trait analyses revealed fishes associated with low disturbance sites had characteristics including stenotopy, lower swimming ability, and egg guarding behavior. Our study is the first to show biotic homogenization of fishes across seagrass meadows within areas of relatively high human impact. These results support the importance of targeting conservation efforts in low anthropogenic disturbance areas across land- and seascapes, as well as managing anthropogenic impacts in high activity areas.},

  abstract = {Salp fecal pellets are rich in organic matter and have been shown to sink at very high velocities. In recent years, salp abundances have been increasing in the Southern Ocean where they seem to be replacing krill as the dominant grazers on phytoplankton. As salps can form large swarms with high pellet production rates, it has been suggested that they will become increasingly important for the vertical export of particulate organic matter in the Southern Ocean. However, detailed studies combining both investigations of pellet production rates, turnover, and export are still needed in order to determine whether salp pellets are important for export (‘sinkers’) or recycling (‘floaters’) of organic matter. Our results suggest that pellets are produced at high rates in the upper few hundred meters of the water column. Although we observed high sinking velocities and low microbial degradation rates of the produced salp pellets, only about one third of the produced pellets were captured in sediment traps placed at 100m and about \textasciitilde 13\% of the produced pellets were exported to sediment traps placed at 300m. The high retention of these fast-settling pellets seems to be caused by break-up and loosening of the pellets, possibly by zooplankton and salps themselves. We measured 3-fold lower size-specific sinking velocities in loosened and fragmented compared to freshly produced intact pellets-. This enhanced the residence times ({$>$}1day) of both small and large pellets in the upper water column. We postulate that the fragile nature of salp pellets make them more important for recycling of organic matter in the upper mesopelagic layer rather than as a conduit for export of particulate organic matter to the seafloor.},

In Rivers, Knight and Bute Inlet, the deep water temperature increased by 1.2–1.3°C over 70 years, up to two times the global average for open ocean waters at corresponding depths, while salinity increased by 0.1–0.2, and oxygen decreased by 0.4–0.7 mLL−1.

The cause of the decline is still not fully understood; however, bottom-up drivers and trophic interactions during the early marine migration are considered to be important contributing factors. McKinnell et al. (Fisheries Oceanography, 23, 2014 and 322) developed a “trophic gauntlet hypothesis,” proposing that low biological productivity leads to an energy deficit from poor foraging opportunities in migrating salmon. When combined with poor foraging conditions in typically productive waters elsewhere on the migration, low marine survival may result. Our study examined prey availability and stomach fullness of juvenile sockeye salmon along the 120 km stretch of the coastal migration through the Discovery Islands and Johnstone Strait to determine whether this section of the migration is indeed food limited. We observed low stomach fullness throughout tidally mixed waters, providing empirical support for the trophic gauntlet hypothesis. Zooplankton abundance was high in these regions so it appeared that unfavourably small prey size may have been the cause of low foraging success. We also observed foraging hotspots at both ends of the gauntlet, indicating that such areas may be key feeding grounds for migratory salmon.},

Along the northwest coast of North America, declining trajectories of Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii) have prompted interest in improving the understanding of its population and community dynamics to better guide future conservation and management strategies. To improve future population estimates and understanding of the ecological factors governing herring egg survival, the magnitude, spatial variation and mechanisms driving herring egg loss rates were quantified. This was achieved by way of repeated observational field surveys and a predator exclusion experiment. Observational surveys revealed that regional egg loss rates (Z) were substantial and ranged from 0.101 ± 0.019 to 0.134 ± 0.028, the equivalent of 88–94\% egg loss over a 21 day incubation period, or 50–60\% egg loss over 6.8 days, the average time lag between spawn deposition and annual egg surveys. Furthermore, spatial variation was high, with egg loss rates varying 5-fold among study sites. Depth, time since spawn, and spawn area were primary spatial drivers of egg loss, but predator abundance and exposure were secondarily important. Experimental evidence showed that benthic predation and habitat type were strong drivers of egg loss, suggesting that a high proportion of eggs, particularly those spawned on benthic substrates, are consumed by predators. These results have important conservation implications for managers and ecologists seeking to estimate herring biomass and to understand the environmental influences on predator–prey interactions that affect herring dynamics.},

  abstract = {There is a growing need to better understand the potential impacts of altered thermal regimes on biodiversity and ecosystem function as mean temperatures, and the likelihood of extreme temperatures, continue to increase. One valuable approach to identify mechanisms and pathways of thermally driven change at the community level is through the manipulation of temperature in the field. However, where methods exist, they are often costly or unable to produce ecologically relevant changes in temperature. Here, we present a low-cost, easily assembled and readily customizable thermal manipulation system for tide pools or other small bodies of water—the Seaside Array for Understanding Thermal Effects (SAUTE)—and demonstrate its ability to effectively alter the temperature in tide pools. During our 3-hr heating manipulation, heated pools reached temperatures 4℃ warmer than unmanipulated pools. During the cooling manipulation, cooled pools remained on average 1.8℃ cooler than control pools. The novel SAUTE system can be used to alter the temperature of tide pools in situ. Furthermore, it could be modified to heat other environments such as freshwater vernal pools and settlement tiles in a realistic and meaningful manner, serving as a useful tool to test questions surrounding the relationship between climate warming, thermal variability and ecological processes in natural aquatic communities.},

  abstract = {Hydrometeorological observations of small watersheds of the northeast Pacific coastal temperate rainforest (NPCTR) of North America are important to understand land to ocean ecological connections and to provide the scientific basis for regional environmental management decisions. The Hakai Institute operates a densely networked and long-term hydrometeorological monitoring observatory that fills a spatial data gap in the remote and sparsely gauged outer coast of the NPCTR. Here we present the first 5 water years (October 2013–October 2019) of high-resolution streamflow and weather data from seven small (\&lt; 13 km2) coastal watersheds. Measuring rainfall and streamflow in remote and topographically complex rainforest environments is challenging; hence, advanced and novel automated measurement methods were used. These methods, specifically for streamflow measurement, allowed us to quantify uncertainty and identify key sources of error, which varied by gauging location. Average yearly rainfall was 3267 mm, resulting in 2317 mm of runoff and 0.1087 km3 of freshwater exports from all seven watersheds per year. However, rainfall and runoff were highly variable, depending on the location and elevation. The seven watersheds have rainfall-dominated (pluvial) streamflow regimes, streamflow responses are rapid, and most water exports are driven by high-intensity fall and winter storm events. The complete hourly and 5 min interval datasets can be accessed at https://doi.org/10.21966/J99C-9C14 (Korver et al., 2021), and accompanying watershed delineations with metrics can be found at https://doi.org/10.21966/1.15311 (Gonzalez Arriola et al., 2015).},

  abstract = {Coastal communities worldwide rely on small-scale artisanal fisheries as a means of increasing food security and alleviating poverty. Even small-scale fishing activities, however, are prone to resource depletion and environmental degradation, which can erode livelihoods in the long run. Thus, there is a pressing need to identify viable and resilient artisanal fisheries, and generate knowledge to support management within the context of a rapidly changing climate. We examined the ecosystem-level consequences of an artisanal kelp fishery (Macrocystis pyrifera), finding small-scale harvest of this highly productive species poses minimal impacts on kelp recovery rates, survival, and biomass dynamics, and abundances of associated commercial and culturally important fish species. These results suggest that small-scale harvest poses minimal trade-offs for the other economic benefits provided by these ecosystems, and their inherent, spiritual, and cultural value to humans. However, we detected a negative impact of warmer seawater temperatures on kelp recovery rates following harvest, indicating that the viability of harvest, even at small scales, may be threatened by future increases in global ocean temperature. This suggests that negative impacts of artisanal fisheries may be more likely to arise in the context of a warming climate, further highlighting the widespread effects of global climate change on coastal fisheries and livelihoods.},

  abstract = {PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Morphology and material properties are the main components of the mechanical design of organisms, with species groups developing different optimization strategies in the context of their physical environment. For intertidal and subtidal seaweeds, possessing highly flexible and extensible tissues allows individuals to bend and reconfigure in flow, thereby reducing drag. Previous research has shown that aging may compromise these qualities. Tissue age increases with distance from the blade's meristem, which differs in its position on kelps and red algae. Here, we assess whether longitudinal patterns of blade material properties differ between these two algal groups according to tissue age. METHODS: We performed tensile tests on tissues samples excised from various positions along the extent of blades in nine kelp species (basal growth) and 15 species of red algae (apical growth). KEY RESULTS: We found that older tissues were less flexible and extensible than younger tissues in all species tested. As predicted, tissue near the basal meristem in kelp was more flexible and extensible than older tissue at the blade's distal end. The opposite pattern was observed for red algae, with the most flexible and extensible tissues found near the apical meristem at the distal ends of blades. CONCLUSIONS: We propose that divergent patterns in the distribution of material properties along blades may have different consequences for the performance of kelps and red algae. The positioning of younger tissues at the blade base for kelps may enable these species to attain larger body sizes in wave-swept habitats.},

Although local evidence suggests that kelp forests are increasingly threatened by a variety of stressors, no comprehensive global analysis of change in kelp abundances currently exists. Here, we build and analyze a global database of kelp time series spanning the past half-century to assess regional and global trends in kelp abundances. We detected a high degree of geographic variation in trends, with regional variability in the direction and magnitude of change far exceeding a small global average decline (instantaneous rate of change = −0.018 y−1). Our analysis identified declines in 38\% of ecoregions for which there are data (−0.015 to −0.18 y−1), increases in 27\% of ecoregions (0.015 to 0.11 y−1), and no detectable change in 35\% of ecoregions. These spatially variable trajectories reflected regional differences in the drivers of change, uncertainty in some regions owing to poor spatial and temporal data coverage, and the dynamic nature of kelp populations. We conclude that although global drivers could be affecting kelp forests at multiple scales, local stressors and regional variation in the effects of these drivers dominate kelp dynamics, in contrast to many other marine and terrestrial foundation species.},

  abstract = {Managing for simultaneous recovery of interacting species, particularly top predators and their prey, is a longstanding challenge in applied ecology and conservation. The effects of sea otters (Enhydra lutris kenyoni) on abalone (Haliotis spp.) is a salient example along North America's west coast where sea otters are recovering from 18th- and 19th-century fur trade while efforts are being made to recover abalone from more recent overfishing. To understand the direct and indirect effects of sea otters on northern abalone (H. kamtschatkana) and the relative influence of biotic and abiotic conditions, we surveyed subtidal rocky reef sites varying in otter occupation time in three regions of British Columbia, Canada. Sites occupied by sea otters for over 30 years had 16 times lower densities of exposed abalone than sites where otters have yet to recover (0.46 ± 0.08/20 m2 vs. 7.56 ± 0.98/20 m2), but they also had higher densities of cryptic abalone (2.17 ± 1.31/20 m2 vs. 1.31 ± 0.20/20 m2). Abalone densities were greater in deeper vs. shallower habitats at sites with sea otters compared to sites without otters. Sea otter effects on exposed abalone density were three times greater in magnitude than those of any other factor, whereas substrate and wave exposure effects on cryptic abalone were six times greater than those of sea otters. While higher substrate complexity may benefit abalone by providing refugia from sea otter predation, laboratory experiments revealed that it may also lead to higher capture efficiency by sunflower stars (Pycnopodia helianthoides), a ubiquitous mesopredator, compared to habitat with lower complexity. Sea otter recovery indirectly benefitted abalone by decreasing biomass of predatory sunflower stars and competitive grazing sea urchins, while increasing stipe density and depth of kelp that provides food and protective habitat. Importantly, abalone persisted in the face of sea otter recovery, albeit at lower densities of smaller and more cryptic individuals. We provide empirical evidence of how complex ecological interactions influence the effects of recovering predators on their recovering prey. This ecosystem-based understanding can inform conservation trade-offs when balancing multifaceted ecological, cultural, and socio-economic objectives for species at risk.},

The surfaces of marine macroalgae support diverse microbial biofilms, yet the degree of microbial variation between alternate phases is unknown. We quantified bacterial (16S rRNA gene) and microeukaryote (18S rRNA gene) communities on the surface of the common intertidal seaweed, Mastocarpus spp., which alternates between gametophyte (foliose, haploid) and sporophyte (encrusting, diploid) life history phases. A large portion (97\%) of bacterial taxa on the surface Mastocarpus was also present in samples from the environment, indicating that macroalgal surface communities are largely assembled from the surrounding seawater. Still, changes in the relative abundance of bacterial taxa result in significantly different communities on alternate Mastocarpus life history phases, rocky substrate and seawater at all intertidal elevations. For microeukaryote assemblages, only high intertidal samples had significant differences between life history phases although sporophytes were not different from the rocky substrate at this elevation; gametophytes and sporophytes did not differ in microeukaryote communities in the mid and low zones. By sequencing three host genes, we identified three cryptic species of Mastocarpus in our data set, which co-occur in the mid-to-low intertidal zone. In these samples, M. alaskensis sporophytes harboured distinct bacterial communities compared to M. agardhii and M. intermedius sporophytes, which were not distinguishable. Conversely, microeukaryote communities did not differ among species.},

  abstract = {Kelp forest ecosystems are biodiversity hotspots, providing habitat for dense assemblages of marine organisms and nutrients for marine and terrestrial food webs. The surfaces of kelps support diverse microbial communities that facilitate the transfer of carbon from algal primary production to higher trophic levels. We quantified the diversity of bacteria on the surfaces of eight sympatric kelp species from four sites in British Columbia. Kelp-associated bacterial communities are significantly different from their environment, even though 86\% of their bacterial taxa are shared with seawater and 97\% are shared with rocky substrate. This differentiation is driven by differences in relative abundance of the bacterial taxa present. Similarly, a large portion of bacterial taxa (37\%) is shared among all eight kelp species, yet differential abundance of bacterial taxa underlies differences in community structure among species. Kelp-associated bacterial diversity does not track host phylogeny; instead bacterial community composition is correlated with the life-history strategy of the host, with annual and perennial kelps supporting divergent bacterial communities. These data provide the first community-scale investigation of kelp forest-associated bacterial diversity. More broadly, this study provides insight into mechanisms that may structure bacterial communities among closely related sympatric host species.},

  abstract = {Clam gardens are ancient mariculture features developed by Indigenous Peoples of the Northwest Coast of North America that create shallow sloping intertidal shelves where clam productivity is enhanced. We quantify the area of clam habitat created by constructing rock-walled clam gardens terraces in northern Quadra Island, British Columbia, Canada. We combined modelling, high-resolution mapping, beach sampling, and a comprehensive survey of the shoreline to document the location and areal extent of clam habitat in clam gardens today. We divided our analysis into three classes of clam gardens, which differ in substrate and thus the amount of clam habitat created. We found that Indigenous People built clam garden walls on 35\% of the shoreline and that about 112,979~m2 of flat beach terrace were created by clam garden construction. Collectively, the three classes of clam gardens increased clam habitat area between 26 and 36\%. About 35\% of the area of clam habitat in clam gardens was constructed de novo on bedrock shelves and rocky slopes where no clam habitat existed previously. Furthermore, about 12.0\% of clam gardens are smaller than 30~m2, reflecting the effort put into creating enhanced food production wherever possible. Our analysis demonstrates that clam management in the form of clam gardens was extensive prior to colonization and that these features still have a significant impact on today’s intertidal ecosystems. Clam habitat expansion facilitated by clam garden construction encouraged a sustainable and abundant food source in the past and could do so again in today’s changing environmental conditions.},

  abstract = {While there is increasing recognition among archaeologists of the extent to which non-agricultural societies have managed their terrestrial ecosystems, the traditional management of marine ecosystems has largely been ignored. In this paper, we bring together Indigenous ecological knowledge, coastal geomorphological observations, and archaeological data to document how Northwest Coast First Nations cultivated clams to maintain and increase productivity. We focus on “clam gardens,” walled intertidal terraces constructed to increase bivalve habitat and productivity. Our survey and excavations of clam gardens in four locations in British Columbia provide insights into the ecological and social context, morphology, construction, and first reported ages of these features. These data demonstrate the extent of traditional maricultural systems among coastal First Nations and, coupled with previously collected information on terrestrial management, challenge us to broaden our definition of “forager” as applied to Northwest Coast peoples. This study also highlights the value of combining diverse kinds of knowledge, including archaeological data, to understand the social and ecological contexts of traditional management systems., RésuméSi bien se observa, a partir de la arqueología, un mayor reconocimiento sobre la medida de incursión de las sociedad no-agrícolas en el manejo sus ecosistemas terrestres, el manejo tradicional de los ecosistemas marinos ha sido considerablemente ignorado.

Using an historical-ecological approach, we describe our novel methods and initial results for documenting the history of three cultural keystone places in coastal British Columbia, Canada: Hauyat, Laxgalts'ap (Old Town) and Dałk Gyilakyaw (Robin Town) (territories of Heiltsuk, Gitga'ata, and Gitsm'geelm, respectively). We combine data and knowledge from diverse disciplines and communities to tell the deep and recent histories of these cultural landscapes. Each of CKPs encompasses expansive landscapes of diverse habitats transformed by generations of people interacting with their surrounding environments.

We evaluate each proxy based on the reliability and specificity of the inference for indicating RSL position, allowing us to weight different methods of data collection. We determine that central Douglas Channel was ice-free following the Last Glacial Maximum by ∼14,500 BP and RSL was at least 90~m higher than today. Isostatic rebound caused RSL to fall to 21~m asl by 11,500 BP, though there may have been a glacial re-advance that would have paused RSL fall around the beginning of the Younger Dryas. RSL fell to 10–15~m asl by 10,000 BP, and continued to drop at a slower rate towards its current position, which it reached by ∼1800 years ago. This is the first well-constrained RSL reconstruction for a nearly 400~km stretch between the northern and central coasts of British Columbia, Canada. This reconstruction provides information about the timing and rate of deglaciation of western North America and exemplifies variability among sea level trends across the region. Long-term RSL reconstructions are integral to explorations of coastal change and archaeological inquiries into early coastal occupations.},

  abstract = {Industrial lead (Pb) emissions have changed oceanic Pb concentrations and isotopic compositions significantly over the last century. Asian industrial emissions are currently the dominant Pb sources in the northwest and central Pacific Ocean. This study investigated major Pb sources in the northeast Pacific Ocean (inland, coastal, and open ocean), where no comprehensive data exist currently. We measured Pb concentrations and isotopic compositions of a variety of shellfish and fish collected in British Columbia (BC) and used them for Pb source apportionment applications in the marine environment. We identified a clear trend in Pb isotopic compositions, from higher 206Pb/207Pb in inland fish to lower 206Pb/207Pb in open ocean fish, with coastal fish possessing mid-range values. These results indicate that natural sources of Pb dominate freshwater ecosystems in the central BC coast, whereas anthropogenic Pb sources prevail in western North America and the northeast Pacific. Pacific herring that forage along BC coast exhibit Pb isotopic composition that deviates toward the Chinese Pb regression line. We estimate an Asian origin for about one third of their total Pb. This study shows that Pb isotopes in aquatic organisms are valuable tools for assessing Pb sources across coastal and offshore regions of the northeast Pacific, with great potential for identifying primary foraging areas of marine organisms.},

  abstract = {Bacteria are integral to marine carbon cycling. They transfer organic carbon to higher trophic levels and remineralise it into inorganic forms. Kelp forests are among the most productive ecosystems within the global oceans, yet the diversity and metabolic capacity of bacteria that transform kelp carbon is poorly understood. Here, we use 16S amplicon and metagenomic shotgun sequencing to survey bacterial communities associated with the surfaces of the giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera and assess the capacity of these bacteria for carbohydrate metabolism. We find that Macrocystis-associated communities are distinct from the water column, and that they become more diverse and shift in composition with blade depth, which is a proxy for tissue age. These patterns are also observed in metagenomic functional profiles, though the broader functional groups—carbohydrate active enzyme families—are largely consistent across samples and depths. Additionally, we assayed more than 250 isolates cultured from Macrocystis blades and the surrounding water column for the ability to utilize alginate, the primary polysaccharide in Macrocystis tissue. The majority of cultured bacteria (66\%) demonstrated this capacity; we find that alginate utilization is patchily distributed across diverse genera in the Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria, yet can also vary between isolates with identical 16S rRNA sequences. The genes encoding enzymes involved in alginate metabolism were detected in metagenomic data across taxonomically diverse bacterial communities, further indicating this capacity is likely widespread amongst bacteria in kelp forests. Overall, the M. pyrifera epibiota shifts across a depth gradient, demonstrating a connection between bacterial assemblage and host tissue state.},

  abstract = {Temperate coastal marine environments are typified by strong seasonality and highly productive annual spring phytoplankton blooms. However, in areas of strong tidal activity, coastal waters may remain in a state of low productivity year-round due to light limitation induced by deep mixing. Such high-nutrient low-chlorophyll (HNLC) environments can be found in British Columbia, Alaska, Argentina, and the United Kingdom. This study aimed to examine how zooplankton communities are shaped by tidally mixed environments through direct comparison of adjacent stratified and mixed regions on the British Columbia coast. Stations located in five distinct regions of coastal BC were sampled during the most productive months (April to July) over two years. The most seasonally stratified station was characterized by a higher biomass of large zooplankton species, including calanoid copepods and euphausiids. In contrast, the mixed regions had a higher abundance of small ({$<$}2~mm) zooplankton species and a prevalence of meroplankton taxa. Zooplankton communities in tidally mixed regions had indicator species that reflected source waters in an adjacent stratified area. However, despite different source waters, tidally mixed regions showed a convergence of community structure pointing to a common community modification process. It may be the result of a combination of advective processes, zooplankton vertical migration behavior, enhanced predation due to close contact with bathymetry and daytime transport to the surface, and a large contribution of meroplankton. In areas with strong tidal exchange, zooplankton communities were more similar than expected based on the physical and chemical characteristics of the water column alone. The mosaic of primary productivity regimes on the BC coast therefore translates into similar spatial scale variation in zooplankton communities, resulting in a spatially heterogenous prey field for zooplankton consumers.},

  abstract = {Classifying the ocean into regions with distinct biogeochemical or physical properties may enhance our interpretation of ocean processes. High-resolution satellite-derived products provide valuable data to address this task. Notwithstanding, no regionalization at a regional scale has been attempted for the coastal and open oceans of British Columbia (BC) and Southeast Alaska (SEA), which host essential habitats for several ecologically, culturally, and commercially important species. Across this heterogeneous marine domain, phytoplankton are subject to dynamic ocean circulation patterns and atmosphere-ocean-land interactions, and their variability, in turn, influences marine food web structure and function. Regionalization based on phytoplankton biomass patterns along BC and SEA’s coastal and open oceans can be valuable in identifying pelagic habitats and representing a baseline for assessing future changes. We developed a two-step classification procedure, i.e., a Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) analysis followed by the affinity propagation clustering method, to define ten bioregions based on the seasonal climatology of high-resolution (300 m) Sentinel-3 surface chlorophyll-a data (a proxy for phytoplankton biomass), for the period 2016-2020. The classification procedure allowed high precision delineation of the ten bioregions, revealing separation between off-shelf bioregions and those in neritic waters. Consistent with the high-nutrient, low-chlorophyll regime, relatively low values of phytoplankton biomass ({$<$} 1 mg/m3) distinguished off-shelf bioregions, which also displayed, on average, more prominent autumn biomass peaks. In sharp contrast, neritic bioregions were highly productive ({$>>$} 1 mg/m3) and characterized by different phytoplankton dynamics. The spring phytoplankton bloom onset varied spatially and inter-annually, with substantial differences among bioregions. The proposed high-spatial-resolution regionalization constitutes a reference point for practical and more extensive implementation in understanding the spatial dynamics of the regional ecology, data-driven ocean observing systems, and objective regional management.},

Archaeologists frequently quantify uncertainty on MRE values as errors computed from single pairs of marine-terrestrial radiocarbon ages, which we argue significantly overstates their accuracy and precision. Here, we review the assumptions, methods, and applications of estimating MRE via an estimate of the additional regional offset between the marine and terrestrial calibration curves (ΔR) for the Prince Rupert Harbour (PRH) region of British Columbia, Canada. We acknowledge the influence on ΔR of MRE variation as (1) a dynamic oceanographic process, (2) its variable expression in biochemical and geochemical pathways, and (3) compounding errors in sample selection, measurement, and calculation. We examine a large set of marine-terrestrial pairs (n = 63) from PRH to compare a common archaeological practice of estimating uncertainty from means that generate an uncertainty value of ±49 years with a revised, more appropriate estimate of error of ± 230 years. However, we argue that the use of multiple-pair samples estimates the PRH ΔR as 273 ± 38 years for the last 5,000 years. Calculations of error that do not consider these issues may generate inaccurate age estimates with unjustifiable precision., El mejor método para cuantificar el efecto reservorio marino (MRE, por sus siglas en inglés) usando la curva global de calibración IntCal Marine 13 permanece sin resolver.

Of special interest is unit 4, a massive to weakly stratified mud containing scattered stones that was deposited during the penultimate Pleistocene glaciation (marine isotope stage (MIS) 4). This unit contains wood and marine shell fragments that have yielded non-finite radiocarbon ages. Sand and silt with thin stringers of peat (unit 3) directly underlie this stony mud, and returned an optical age of 57.3 ± 5.7 ka. The stony mud is unconformably overlain by ponded sediments (unit 5) and advance outwash (unit 6) and till (unit 7) deposited during the Fraser Glaciation (MIS 2). The optically dated unit and a correlative peat and silty sand unit at a nearby exposure have pollen spectra with almost 100\% non-arboreal pollen. Very low values of tree pollen, coupled with high frequencies of sedges, grasses, composites, Ericales, and the arctic−alpine indicator Koenigia islandica, indicate tundra vegetation and a cold climate. Abundant coprophilous Sporormiella (69\%–91\%) and Sordaria type (14\%–47\%) fungal spores in the peat samples indicate the former presence of grazing mammals at Cape Ball during MIS 4. During the MIS 3 interstade, subalpine forest existed at low elevations on Graham Island, providing environments suitable for the development of genetically distinct bird and mammal populations that survived in lowland refugia during the Fraser Glaciation.},

We assembled data on fish bones from 171 archaeological sites from Alaska, British Columbia, and Washington to provide proxy measures of past herring distribution and abundance. The dataset represents 435,777 fish bones, dating throughout the Holocene, but primarily to the last 2,500 y. Herring is the single-most ubiquitous fish taxon (99\% ubiquity) and among the two most abundant taxa in 80\% of individual assemblages. Herring bones are archaeologically abundant in all regions, but are superabundant in the northern Salish Sea and southwestern Vancouver Island areas. Analyses of temporal variability in 50 well-sampled sites reveals that herring exhibits consistently high abundance ({$>$}20\% of fish bones) and consistently low variance ({$<$}10\%) within the majority of sites (88\% and 96\%, respectively). We pose three alternative hypotheses to account for the disjunction between modern and archaeological herring populations. We reject the first hypothesis that the archaeological data overestimate past abundance and underestimate past variability. We are unable to distinguish between the second two hypotheses, which both assert that the archaeological data reflect a higher mean abundance of herring in the past, but differ in whether variability was similar to or less than that observed recently. In either case, sufficient herring was consistently available to meet the needs of harvesters, even if variability is damped in the archaeological record. These results provide baseline information prior to herring depletion and can inform modern management.},

  abstract = {Domestic dogs (Canis familiaris) occur in the archaeological record throughout North America but few zooarchaeological studies have examined the extent of wild and domestic canids using multi-site observations across regions. Here, we present a meta-analysis of 172,310 mammal specimens identified from 210 archaeological sites along the Northwest Coast focusing on canid abundance, distribution, and osteological identifications. We show that canids have a ubiquitous geographic distribution and a high relative abundance in particular Northwest Coast sub-regions and that species-level identifications are overwhelmingly of domestic dogs in contrast to \textasciitilde 1\% of non-domestic canids (wolf, coyote, and fox). Along with geochemical and genetic data, these zooarchaeological observations indicate a variety of roles for dogs including hunting, companionship, and wool production in a region lacking terrestrial agriculture and domestic livestock. We suggest the frequently applied taxonomic status of ‘indeterminate canid’ underestimates the extent to which domestic dogs played key roles in regional economies and cultural practices. Increased attention to resolving taxonomic ambiguity of canids through improving comparative collections and osteometric datasets will help clarify the non-conventional domestication pathways practiced by Northwest Coast peoples.},

  abstract = {Fisheries are of fundamental importance to Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest of North America today and in the past but few archaeological analyses have documented geographic patterning in fisheries across the entire region. This paper adopts meta-analysis methods and GIS-based spatial visualizations to survey the single largest compilation of fine-screened zooarchaeological fisheries data reported to date, including 513,605 fish remains identified at 222 sites from Oregon to southeast Alaska. These systematically collected zooarchaeological data indicate the most ubiquitous and proportionally abundant fish taxa over the late Holocene and reveal previously undocumented spatial patterning, indicating where certain fish taxa are consistently found in high relative proportions. Rather than seeking to evaluate chronological and/or evolutionary change, this study explores the environmental and cultural basis for assessing variability in Indigenous fisheries over millennial time scales. Specifically, we observe Pacific herring and the Pacific salmons to be the two most ubiquitous and proportionally abundant fish taxa across the Northwest Coast followed by flatfishes, sculpins, rockfishes, greenlings, dogfish, and a host of other poorly known taxa that represent consistent fishing effort. We document geographic patterning in the abundance and ubiquity of a range of fish including greater abundance of salmons in northern portions of the study area and outline trends that could represent biogeographic ranges for northern anchovy, Pacific hake, and pollock, among others. We conclude that examining patterning in the ubiquity and rank-order abundance represented by archaeological fisheries data offers significant potential for linking regionally distinct cultural practices noted in the 18th and 19th centuries to much longer human and ecological histories over the Holocene.},

  abstract = {Accurate soil organic carbon (SOC) maps are needed to predict the terrestrial SOC feedback to climate change, one of the largest remaining uncertainties in Earth system modeling. Over the last decade, global scale models have produced varied predictions of the size and distribution of SOC stocks, ranging from 1000 to {$>$}3000 Pg of C within the top 1 m. Regional assessments may help validate or improve global maps because they can examine landscape controls on SOC stocks and offer a tractable means to retain regionally-specific information, such as soil taxonomy, during database creation and modeling. We compile a new transboundary SOC stock database for coastal watersheds of the North Pacific coastal temperate rainforest, using soil classification data to guide gap-filling and machine learning approaches to explore spatial controls on SOC and predict regional stocks. Precipitation and topographic attributes controlling soil wetness were found to be the dominant controls of SOC, underscoring the dependence of C accumulation on high soil moisture. The random forest model predicted stocks of 4.5 Pg C (to 1 m) for the study region, 22\% of which was stored in organic soil layers. Calculated stocks of 228 ± 111 Mg C ha−1 fell within ranges of several past regional studies and indicate 11–33 Pg C may be stored across temperate rainforest soils globally. Predictions compared very favorably to regionalized estimates from two spatially-explicit global products (Pearson’s correlation: ρ = 0.73 versus 0.34). Notably, SoilGrids 250 m was an outlier for estimates of total SOC, predicting 4-fold higher stocks (18 Pg C) and indicating bias in this global product for the soils of the temperate rainforest. In sum our study demonstrates that CTR ecosystems represent a moisture-dependent hotspot for SOC storage at mid-latitudes.},

Spectral analysis of time series data showed that during spring in Alaskan waters, a range of tidal frequencies dominated pH variability, while seasonal oceanographic conditions were the dominant driver in Canadian waters.

Between 1985 and 2013, glacier coverage decreased by up to 2\% of catchment area for the 35 study catchments. The mean wastage flux contribution to streamflow had a positive relation with fractional glacier coverage and an inverse relation with catchment water yield. Glacier mass change estimates suggest that wastage flux contributions declined between 1985–1999 and 2000–2018, but the estimates are subject to substantial uncertainty. Annual wastage flux contributions over a four-year period for two study catchments ranged from 8 to 13\% of annual water yield for a catchment with 17\% glacier cover, with glaciers extending below treeline, and 9–19\% for a smaller alpine catchment with 57\% glacier cover. After accounting statistically for climatic forcing and non-glacial contributions to streamflow, August runoff from glacierized catchments decreased through time at a rate that was linearly related to loss of glacier cover. The analyses suggest that glacier-melt contributions to August runoff have already have passed peak water, and that these reductions have exacerbated a regional climate-driven trend to decreased August streamflow contributions from unglacierized areas.},

  abstract = {Given the substantial contributions of forest biodiversity and ecosystem services to society, forest sciences have a large potential to contribute to the integrity and sustainability of our future. This is especially true when the roles of biodiversity for sustaining ecosystem services are considered. The rapid expansion of sustainable forest management (SFM) has resulted in the adoption of various forest management frameworks intended to safeguard biodiversity. Concurrently, the importance of forest ecosystem services has been increasingly recognized. Although some initiatives aimed at conserving both biodiversity and ecosystem services are emerging, knowledge gaps still exist about their relationships and potential trade-offs in forests. Given recent advancements, increasing opportunities and some lags in forest ecology, further research on biodiversity, ecosystem functions and services will play substantial roles in the development of SFM practices. Here, we identified key issues including (i) relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem function as a foundation of ecological integrity, (ii) resilience thinking to better prepare for and adapt to environmental changes, (iii) social–ecological perspectives that facilitate real-world conservation and management and (iv) theory-driven restoration that bridges science and practice. Thus, we illustrate priorities and future possibilities in applied ecology studies in forests, which will help society and ecosystems to build capacity and resilience to face uncertainty in the changing environment. Synthesis and applications. Under substantial human influences, forests are highly likely to be largely altered, potentially leading to the emergence of novel ecosystems or alternative stable states. Management thus needs more flexible, novel measures to address the significant uncertainty this generates. Resilience-based approaches are important to respond adaptively to future changes and cope with surprises, potentially providing multiple options. Although challenges exist, theory should play an important role in managing, conserving and restoring forest ecosystems. The issues discussed here should receive further attention in the context of the multiple goals of sustainable forest management.},

  abstract = {There is growing interest in the use of Unoccupied Aerial Systems (UAS) for mapping and monitoring of seagrass habitats. UAS provide flexibility with timing of imagery capture, are relatively inexpensive, and obtain very high spatial resolution imagery compared to imagery acquired from sensors mounted on satellite or piloted aircraft. However, research to date has focused on UAS applications for exposed intertidal areas or clear tropical waters. In contrast, submerged seagrass meadows in temperate regions are subject to high cloud cover and water column turbidity, which may limit the application of UAS imagery for coastal habitat mapping. To test the constraints on UAS seagrass mapping, we examined the effects of five environmental conditions at the time of UAS image acquisition (sun angle, tidal height, cloud cover, Secchi depth and wind speed) and five site characteristics (eelgrass patchiness and density, presence and density of non-eelgrass submerged aquatic vegetation, sediment tone, eelgrass deep edge and site exposure) at 26 eelgrass (Zostera marina) monitoring sites in British Columbia, Canada. Eelgrass was delineated in UAS orthomosaics using object-based image analysis, combining image segmentation with manual classification. Each site was ranked according to the analysts’ confidence in the delineated eelgrass. Robust Linear Regression revealed sun angle and ‘theoretical visibility’ (an aggregate of tidal height, Secchi depth, and eelgrass deep edge conditions) to be the most important variables affecting mapping confidence. In general, ideal environmental conditions to obtain high confidence eelgrass mapping included: (1) sun angles below 40°; (2) positive theoretical visibility with Secchi depths {$>$}5 m; (3) cloud cover conditions of {$<$}10\% or {$>$}90\%; and (4) wind speeds less than 5 km h−1. Additionally, high mapping confidence was achieved for sites with dense, continuous, and homogeneous eelgrass meadows. The results of this analysis will guide implementation of UAS mapping technologies in coastal temperate regions.},

  abstract = {Phosphorus (P) is an essential nutrient for plant growth, but soil P concentrations decline with increasing soil age. Phosphorus often limits tree growth within the hypermaritime Coastal Western Hemlock zone in British Columbia, Canada, particularly where parent material with low P concentrations have experienced rapid weathering. To sustainably manage forests in this region, more information is needed about changes in soil P concentrations and dynamics that occur with time. This study characterized the forms and abundance of soil and foliar P compounds using a soil chronosequence developed on aeolian sand dunes on Calvert Island and compared results to chronosequences in other locations. Eight time points were examined, from a modern foredune to a relict, stabilized dune (\textasciitilde 10,760 years old). Soil horizons were analyzed for bulk density, pH, and concentrations of total carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and total P (TP), iron (Fe), and aluminum (Al), total organic P (Po), and Mehlich-extractable P and cations. For each site, P forms in L, H and organically-enriched mineral (M) horizons were characterized with solution 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (P-NMR), as were foliar samples from tree species spanning all age classes except the youngest dune. This chronosequence followed the Walker and Syers (1976) model, with an exponential decline in TP mass and a humped-shape curve in Po mass with increasing age. The L horizon had lower TP concentrations than foliage samples, but similar P forms. The H horizons had a greater proportion of DNA, phosphonates and nucleotides than the L horizon and increased proportions of myo- and scyllo-inositol hexakisphosphate (IHP) with increasing age. The mineral horizons had much lower TP concentrations than other horizons and increased proportions of IHP and DNA with increasing age, which were correlated to increased exchangeable and amorphous Al concentrations. In all sample types, the proportion of orthophosphate declined with increasing age. These results enhance knowledge of P cycling within hypermaritime soils, particularly the P decline that will occur with age. This will aid in the sustainable management of the low-productivity forests typical of these ecosystems.},

At present, however, this region remains a largely understudied portion of coastal North America. This study describes the luminescence characteristics of quartz and K-feldspar from coastal dune and beach sands on Calvert Island and develops a suitable optical dating protocol that will allow for a more rigorous chronology for post-glacial landscape evolution and human occupation on British Columbia's central coast. Luminescence signals from Calvert Island quartz are dim, and appear to lack the so-called “fast” component that is most desirable for optical dating. K-feldspar signals are sufficiently bright for optical dating. We test and refine a single-aliquot regenerative-dose (SAR) protocol for K-feldspar specific to Calvert Island samples through a series of dose recovery and preheat plateau tests. Two approaches for correcting a sample age for anomalous fading are compared and a correction for phototransfer is introduced and applied. Measured fading rates vary from sample to sample implying that, in this region, it is not sufficient to rely on two or three representative fading rates as has sometimes been done elsewhere. Refined age estimates show consistency with independent radiocarbon dating control and help identify radiocarbon-dated organic-rich sediments that have been reworked.},

  abstract = {Rock-walled archaeological features are notoriously hard to date, largely because of the absence of suitable organic material for radiocarbon dating. This study demonstrates the efficacy of dating clam garden wall construction using optical dating, and uses optical ages to determine how sedimentation rates in the intertidal zone are affected by clam garden construction. Clam gardens are rock-walled, intertidal terraces that were constructed and maintained by coastal First Nation peoples to increase bivalve habitat and productivity. These features are evidence of ancient shellfish mariculture on the Pacific Northwest and, based on radiocarbon dating, date to at least the late Holocene. Optical dating exploits the luminescence signals of quartz or feldspar minerals to determine the last time the minerals were exposed to sunlight (i.e., their burial age), and thus does not require the presence of organic material. Optical ages were obtained from three clam garden sites on northern Quadra Island, British Columbia, and their reliability was assessed by comparing them to radiocarbon ages derived from shells underneath the clam garden walls, as well as below the terrace sediments. Our optical and radiocarbon ages suggest that construction of these clam garden walls commenced between \textasciitilde 1000 and \textasciitilde 1700 years ago, and our optical ages suggest that construction of the walls was likely incremental and increased sedimentation rates in the intertidal zone by up to fourfold. Results of this study show that when site characteristics are not amenable to radiocarbon dating, optical dating may be the only viable geochronometer. Furthermore, dating rock-walled marine management features and their geomorphic impact can lead to significant advances in our understanding of the intimate relationships that Indigenous peoples worldwide developed with their seascapes.},

Additionally, the multitrophic impact of marine subsidies has not been traced through food webs across physically diverse islands. Here, we test predictions about how island characteristics can affect marine enrichment of food web constituents and how nutrients flow through island food webs. To evaluate enrichment and trace marine nutrients across food webs, we used stable isotopes of soil, flora, and fauna (n = 4752 samples) collected from 97 islands in British Columbia, Canada. Island area was the strongest predictor of enrichment across taxa; we found that samples were more 15N-rich on smaller islands. Enrichment declined with distance from shore but less so on small islands, implying a higher per-unit-area subsidy effect. These area and distance-to-shore effects were taxon-specific, and nearly twice as strong in basal food web groups. We also found that increases in δ15N correlated with increases in \%N in basal trophic groups, as well as in songbirds, implying biologically relevant uptake of a potentially limiting nutrient. Path analysis demonstrated that subsidies in soil flow through plants and detritivores, and into upper-level consumers. Our results reveal an interplay between island biogeography and marine subsidies in shaping island food webs through bottom-up processes.},

We tested the effects of marine subsidies on species diversity and population density on productive temperate islands, evaluating SIB predictions previously untested at comparable scales and subsidy levels. We found that the diversity of terrestrial breeding bird communities on 91 small islands (approx. 0.0001–3 km2) along the Central Coast of British Columbia, Canada were correlated most strongly with island area, but also with marine subsidies. Species richness increased and population density decreased with island area, but isolation had no measurable influence. Species richness was negatively correlated with marine subsidy, measured as forest-edge soil δ15N. Density, however, was higher on islands with higher marine subsidy, and a negative interaction between area and subsidy indicates that this effect is stronger on smaller islands, offering some support for SIB. Our study emphasizes how subsidies from the sea can shape diversity patterns on islands and can even exceed the importance of isolation in determining species richness and densities of terrestrial biota.},

  abstract = {Although species richness can be determined by different mechanisms at different spatial scales, the role of scale in the effects of marine inputs on island biogeography has not been studied explicitly. Here, we evaluated the potential influence of island characteristics and marine inputs (seaweed wrack biomass and marine-derived nitrogen in the soil) on plant species richness at both a local (plot) and regional (island) scale on 92 islands in British Columbia, Canada. We found that the effects of subsidies on species richness depend strongly on spatial scale. Despite detecting no effects of marine subsidies at the island scale, we found that as plot level subsidies increased, species richness decreased; plots with more marine-derived nitrogen in the soil hosted fewer plant species. We found no effect of seaweed wrack at either scale. To identify potential mechanisms underlying the decrease in diversity, we fit a spatially explicit joint species distribution model to evaluate species level responses to marine subsidies and effects of biotic interactions among species. We found mixed evidence for competition for both light and nutrients, and cannot rule out an alternative mechanism; the observed decrease in species richness may be due to disturbances associated with animal-mediated nutrient deposits, particularly those from North American river otters (Lontra canadensis). By evaluating the scale-dependent effects of marine subsidies on island biogeographic patterns of plants and revealing likely mechanisms that act on community composition, we provide novel insights on the scale dependence of a fundamental ecological theory, and on the rarely examined links between marine and terrestrial ecosystems often bridged by animal vectors.},

  abstract = {Unanticipated declines among exploited species have commonly occurred despite harvests that appeared sustainable prior to collapse. This is particularly true in the oceans where spatial scales of management are often mismatched with spatially complex metapopulations. We explore causes, consequences, and potential solutions for spatial mismatches in harvested metapopulations in three ways. First, we generate novel theory illustrating when and how harvesting metapopulations increases spatial variability and in turn masks local-scale volatility. Second, we illustrate why spatial variability in harvested metapopulations leads to negative consequences using an empirical example of a Pacific herring metapopulation. Finally, we construct a numerical management strategy evaluation model to identify and highlight potential solutions for mismatches in spatial scale and spatial variability. Our results highlight that spatial complexity can promote stability at large scales, however, ignoring spatial complexity produces cryptic and negative consequences for people and animals that interact with resources at small scales. Harvesting metapopulations magnifies spatial variability, which creates discrepancies between regional and local trends while increasing risk of local population collapses. Such effects asymmetrically impact locally constrained fishers and predators, which are more exposed to risks of localized collapses. Importantly, we show that dynamically optimizing harvest can minimize local risk without sacrificing yield. Thus, multiple nested scales of management may be necessary to avoid cryptic collapses in metapopulations and the ensuing ecological, social, and economic consequences.},

  abstract = {The perhumid region of the coastal temperate rainforest (CTR) of Pacific North America is one of the wettest places on Earth and contains numerous small catchments that discharge freshwater and high concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) directly to the coastal ocean. However, empirical data on the flux and composition of DOC exported from these watersheds are scarce. We established monitoring stations at the outlets of seven catchments on Calvert and Hecate islands, British Columbia, which represent the rain-dominated hypermaritime region of the perhumid CTR. Over several years, we measured stream discharge, stream water DOC concentration, and stream water dissolved organic-matter (DOM) composition. Discharge and DOC concentrations were used to calculate DOC fluxes and yields, and DOM composition was characterized using absorbance and fluorescence spectroscopy with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC). The areal estimate of annual DOC yield in water year 2015 was 33.3 Mg C km−2 yr−1, with individual watersheds ranging from an average of 24.1 to 37.7 Mg C km−2 yr−1. This represents some of the highest DOC yields to be measured at the coastal margin. We observed seasonality in the quantity and composition of exports, with the majority of DOC export occurring during the extended wet period (September–April). Stream flow from catchments reacted quickly to rain inputs, resulting in rapid export of relatively fresh, highly terrestrial-like DOM. DOC concentration and measures of DOM composition were related to stream discharge and stream temperature and correlated with watershed attributes, including the extent of lakes and wetlands, and the thickness of organic and mineral soil horizons. Our discovery of high DOC yields from these small catchments in the CTR is especially compelling as they deliver relatively fresh, highly terrestrial organic matter directly to the coastal ocean. Hypermaritime landscapes are common on the British Columbia coast, suggesting that this coastal margin may play an important role in the regional processing of carbon and in linking terrestrial carbon to marine ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Marine management interventions are increasingly being implemented with the explicit goal of rebuilding ocean ecosystems, but early responses may begin with alterations in ecological interactions preceding detectable changes in population-level characteristics. To establish a baseline from which to monitor the effects of spatial protection on reef fish trophic ecology and track future ecosystem-level changes, we quantified temperate reef fish densities, size, biomass, diets and isotopic signatures at nine sites nested within two fished and one five-year old marine protected area (MPA) on the northwest coast of Canada. We calculated rockfish (Sebastes spp.) community and species-specific niche breadth for fished and protected areas based on δ13C and δ15N values. We found that rockfish community niche width was greater inside the MPA relative to adjacent fished reefs due to an expanded nitrogen range, possibly reflecting early changes in trophic interactions following five years of spatial protection. Our data also demonstrated that the MPA had a positive effect on the δ15N signature of rockfish (i.e., trophic position), but the effect of rockfish length on its own was not well-supported. In addition, we found a positive interaction between rockfish length and δ15N signature, such that δ15N signatures of rockfish caught within the MPA increased more rapidly with body size than those caught in fished areas. Differences in rockfish size structure and biomass among fished and unfished areas were not clearly evident. Species of rockfish and lingcod varied in trophic and size responses, indicating that life-history traits play an important role in predicting MPA effects. These results may suggest early changes in trophic behavior of slow-growing rockfish due to predation risk by faster growing higher trophic level predators such as lingcod inside MPAs established on temperate reefs. Consequently, spatial protection may restore both the trophic and behavioral roles of previously fished consumers earlier and in measurable ways sooner than observable changes in abundance and size.},

  abstract = {In seagrass food webs, small invertebrate mesograzers often exert top-down control on algal epiphytes growing on seagrass blades, which in turn releases the seagrass from competition for light and nutrients. Yet, nearshore habitat boundaries are permeable, and allochthonous subsidies can provide alternative food sources to in-situ production in seagrass meadows, which may in turn alter mesograzer-epiphyte interactions. We examined the contribution of allochthonous kelp (Nereocystis luetkeana), autochthonous epiphytic macroalgal (Smithora naiadum), Ulva lactuca, and seagrass production to mesograzer diets in a subtidal Zostera marina (eelgrass) meadow. In both choice feeding experiments and isotopic analysis, mesograzer diets revealed a preference for allochthonous N. luetkeana over Z. marina, S. naiadum, and U. lactuca. Notably, Idotea resecata showed an \textasciitilde 20x greater consumption rate for N. luetkeana in feeding experiments over other macrophytes. In the meadow, we found a positive relationship between epiphytic S. naiadum and gammarid amphipod biomass suggesting weak top-down control on the S. naiadum biomass. Epiphyte biomass may be driven by bottom-up factors such as environmental conditions, or the availability and preference of allochthonous kelp, though further work is needed to disentangle these interactions. Additionally, we found that gammarid and caprellid amphipod biomass were positively influenced by adjacency to kelp at seagrass meadow edges. Our findings suggest that N. luetkeana kelp subsidies are important to the diets of mesograzers in Z. marina meadows.

  abstract = {Diverse habitats composing coastal seascapes occur in close proximity, connected by the flux of materials and fauna across habitat boundaries. Understanding how seascape connectivity alters important ecosystem functions for fish, however, is not well established. For a seagrass-dominant seascape, we predicted that configuration and composition of adjacent habitats would alter habitat access for fauna and trophic subsidies, enhancing nursery function for juvenile fish. In an extensive Zostera marina seagrass meadow, we established sites adjacent to (1) highly complex and productive kelp forests (Nereocystis luetkeana), (2) unvegetated sand habitats, and (3) in the seagrass meadow interior. Using SCUBA, we conducted underwater observations of young-of the-year (YOY) rockfish (Sebastes spp.) recruitment across sites. Using generalized linear mixed effects models, we assessed the role of seascape adjacency relative to seagrass provisions (habitat complexity and prey) on YOY recruitment. YOY rockfish collections were used to trace sources of allochthonous vs. autochthonous primary production in the seagrass food web, via a δ13C and δ15N isotopic mixing model, and prey consumption using stomach contents. Overall, seagrass nursery function was strongly influenced by adjacent habitats and associated subsidies. Allochthonous N. luetkeana was the greatest source of energy assimilated by YOY rockfish within seagrass sites. In seagrass sites adjacent to N. luetkeana kelp forests, YOYs consumed higher quality prey, which corresponded with better body condition relative to sites adjacent to sand. Moreover, kelp forest adjacency enhanced YOY rockfish recruitment within the seagrass meadow, suggesting that habitat complexity is a key seascape feature influencing the nursery function of nearshore habitats. In general, to promote seascape connectivity, the conservation and restoration of nursery habitats should prioritize the inclusion of habitat mosaics of high structural complexity and productivity. We illustrate and emphasize the importance of using a seascape-level approach that considers linkages among habitats for the management of important nearshore ecosystem functions.},

Net samples were collected using an RMT-8 at four major sampling regions in the proximity of the Antarctic Polar Front (APF): along a 10°E transect, Salpastan, 12°W eulerian study, and the South Georgia Basin. Salps, mostly S. thompsoni, were found at all but one station and with few exceptions contributed {$<<$}40\% to total zooplankton in terms of both abundance and biomass. Salp abundance and biomass was lowest (6.2 ind.1000m−3 and 0.8mgDWm−3) north of the APF along the 10°E transect and highest (3150 ind.1000m−3 and 20.5mgDWm−3) at the Salpastan station south of the APF. Size distributions of S. thompsoni aggregates and solitaries, and their developmental dynamics, were similar in all locations except the Salpastan region. In aggregates, the overall salp size distributions were strongly right-tailed with the mass of the distribution always concentrated in the left where small aggregates (6–10mm) dominated. During the eulerian study at 12°W, several cohorts of aggregates and solitaries were traceable allowing assessment of the daily growth rates of S. thompsoni. Estimated in situ growth rates of aggregates and solitaries were 0.53±0.18 and 2.83±0.42mmday−1, respectively, and the complete S. thompsoni life cycle duration (sexual+asexual) during austral summer at the APF region may have been as short as 2–3 months. The rapid growth rates of S. thompsoni found in this study urgently require further research to re-evaluate salp life cycle in the Southern Ocean.},

We investigated the effects of fronts on larval fish assemblages by jointly collecting physical (ADCP and CTD) and biological (larvae) data in the nearshore waters of the south coast of South Africa, on four separate neap-tide occasions. Accumulation of fish larvae at predominantly internal wave-associated fronts was observed, with higher larval densities inshore of and within the front than farther offshore. On each occasion, larvae of coastal species with pelagic eggs (Mugillidae and Sparidae) were numerically dominant at the front itself, while inshore of the front, larvae of coastal species with benthic eggs (Gobiesocidae and Gobiidae) were more abundant. Offshore catches mainly comprised Engraulidae (pelagic species with pelagic eggs) larvae, which were generally restricted to the bottom, where current velocities were onshore on each occasion. On the occasion when fast ({$>$}100 cm/s) currents prevailed, however, accumulation of the larvae of coastal species occurred offshore of the front, and larvae were mixed throughout the water column. Thus, larval occurrence at these coastal frontal systems was strongly affected by the degree of mixing by currents, which on most occasions resulted in onshore retention. The results underline the importance of frontal systems in determining the nearshore distributions of fish larvae, particularly by retaining coastal fish species in the inshore region. The environmental variability observed at these frontal systems has potential implications for larval connectivity of fish populations.},

Canada and the United States share numerous endangered species; their respective acts, the Species at Risk Act (SARA) and the Endangered Species Act (ESA), require documents that outline requirements for species recovery. Although there are many priorities for improving endangered species legislation effectiveness, species recovery goals are a crucial component. We compared recovery goal quality, as measured by goal quantitativeness and ambition, for species listed under SARA and ESA. By comparing across ESA and SARA, the intent of the study was to identify differences and similarities that could support the development of stronger species’ recovery goals under both legislations. Our results indicated that: (1) overall, only 38\% of recovery goals were quantitative, 41\% had high ambition, and 26\% were both quantitative and with high ambition; (2) recovery goals had higher quantitativeness and ambition under ESA than SARA; (3) recovery goals for endangered species had higher ambition than threatened species under ESA and SARA, and; (4) no recovery goal aimed to restore populations to historic levels. Combined, these findings provide guidance to strengthen recovery goals and improve subsequent conservation outcomes. In particular, species at risk planners should seek to attain higher recovery goal ambition, particularly for SARA-listed species, and include quantitative recovery goals wherever possible.},

  abstract = {The mass-balance—elevation relation for a given glacier is required for many numerical models of ice flow. Direct measurements of this relation using remotely-sensed methods are complicated by ice dynamics, so observations are currently limited to glaciers where surface mass-balance measurements are routinely made. We test the viability of using the continuity equation to estimate annual surface mass balance between flux-gates in the absence of in situ measurements, on five glaciers in the Columbia Mountains of British Columbia, Canada. Repeat airborne laser scanning surveys of glacier surface elevation, ice penetrating radar surveys and publicly available maps of ice thickness are used to estimate changes in surface elevation and ice flux. We evaluate this approach by comparing modeled to observed mass balance. Modeled mass-balance gradients well-approximate those obtained from direct measurement of surface mass balance, with a mean difference of +6.6 ± 4\%. Regressing modeled mass balance, equilibrium line altitudes are on average 15~m higher than satellite-observations of the transient snow line. Estimates of mass balance over flux bins compare less favorably than the gradients. Average mean error (+0.03 ± 0.07~m w.e.) between observed and modeled mass balance over flux bins is relatively small, yet mean absolute error (0.55 ± 0.18~m w.e.) and average modeled mass-balance uncertainty (0.57~m w.e.) are large. Mass conservation, assessed with glaciological data, is respected (when estimates are within 1σ uncertainties) for 84\% of flux bins representing 86\% of total glacier area. Uncertainty on ice velocity, especially for areas where surface velocity is low ({$<$}10~m a−1) contributes the greatest error in estimating ice flux. We find that using modeled ice thicknesses yields comparable modeled mass-balance gradients relative to using observations of ice thickness, but we caution against over-interpreting individual flux-bin mass balances due to large mass-balance residuals. Given the performance of modeled ice thickness and the increasing availability of ice velocity and surface topography data, we suggest that similar efforts to produce mass-balance gradients using modern high-resolution datasets are feasible on larger scales.},

  abstract = {The timing of reproduction influences key evolutionary and ecological processes in wild populations. Variation in reproductive timing may be an especially important evolutionary driver in the marine environment, where the high mobility of many species and few physical barriers to migration provide limited opportunities for spatial divergence to arise. Using genomic data collected from spawning aggregations of Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii) across 1600 km of coastline, we show that reproductive timing drives population structure in these pelagic fish. Within a specific spawning season, we observed isolation by distance, indicating that gene flow is also geographically limited over our study area. These results emphasize the importance of considering both seasonal and spatial variation in spawning when delineating management units for herring. On several chromosomes, we detected linkage disequilibrium extending over multiple Mb, suggesting the presence of chromosomal rearrangements. Spawning phenology was highly correlated with polymorphisms in several genes, in particular SYNE2, which influences the development of retinal photoreceptors in vertebrates. SYNE2 is probably within a chromosomal rearrangement in Pacific herring and is also associated with spawn timing in Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus). The observed genetic diversity probably underlies resource waves provided by spawning herring. Given the ecological, economic and cultural significance of herring, our results support that conserving intraspecific genetic diversity is important for maintaining current and future ecosystem processes.},

We use a regional ocean biogeochemical model to simulate CO2 uptake in the GOA under different alkalinity-loading scenarios. The GOA is identified as a current net sink of carbon, though low-alkalinity tidewater glacial runoff suppresses summer coastal carbon uptake. Our model shows that increasing the alkalinity generates an increase in annual CO2 uptake of 1.9–2.7 TgC/yr. This transition is comparable to a projected change in glacial runoff composition (i.e., from tidewater to land-terminating) due to continued climate warming. Our results demonstrate an important local carbon-climate feedback that can significantly increase coastal carbon uptake via enhanced air-sea exchange, with potential implications to the coastal ecosystems in glaciated areas around the world.},

  abstract = {Organic carbon (OC) storage in coastal vegetated ecosystems is increasingly being considered in carbon financing and climate change mitigation strategies. However, spatial heterogeneity in these “blue carbon” stocks among and within habitats has only recently been examined, despite its considerable implications. Seagrass meadows have potential to store significant amounts of carbon in their sediments, yet studies comparing sediment OC content at regional and meadow scales remain sparse. Here, we collected sediment cores from six temperate eelgrass (Zostera marina) meadows on the coast of British Columbia, Canada, to quantify sediment OC stocks, accumulation rates, and sources, and to examine local and regional drivers of variability. Sediment OC content was highly variable—across all sites, stocks in the top 0–5 cm ranged from 83 to 1089 g OC m−2, while the 15–20 cm stocks exhibited a 24-fold difference, from 59 to 1407 g OC m−2. Carbon accumulation rates ranged from 4 to 33 g OC m−2 yr−1. Isotopic mixing models revealed that sediment OC was primarily terrestrial carbon (41.3\%) and canopy-forming kelps (33.3\%), with a smaller contribution of eelgrass (25.3\%). Here, we show that regional variability in OC content exceeds meadow-scale variability. This result is likely driven by landscape factors, most notably relative water motion, representing a more dominant control on seagrass OC accumulation than meadow-scale factors such as canopy complexity. These findings elicit caution when scaling up seagrass meadow OC content and demonstrate that measures of the hydrodynamic environment could improve estimates of carbon storage in temperate soft sediment habitats.},

  abstract = {There is increasing urgency to implement climate change mitigation strategies that enhance greenhouse gas removal from the atmosphere and reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Recently, coastal “blue carbon” habitats⁠—mangroves, salt marshes, and seagrass meadows—have received attention for their ability to capture CO2 and store organic carbon (OC), primarily in their sediments. Across habitat types and regions, however, information about the sequestration rates and sources of carbon to local sediments remains sparse. Here we compiled recently obtained estimates of sediment OC stocks and sequestration rates from 139 cores collected from temperate seagrass (Zostera marina) meadows in Alaska, British Columbia, Washington, and Oregon. Across all cores sediment OC content averaged 0.75\%. Organic carbon stocks in the top 25 cm and 1 m of the sediment averaged 1,846 and 7,168 g OC m−2, respectively. Carbon sequestration rates ranged from 4.6 to 93.0 g OC m−2 yr−1 and averaged 24.8 g OC m−2 yr−1. Isotopic data from this region suggest that OC in the sediments is largely from noneelgrass sources. In general, these values are comparable to those from other temperate Z. marina meadows, but significantly lower than previously reported values for seagrasses globally. These results further highlight the need for local and species-level quantification of blue carbon parameters. While temperate eelgrass meadows may not sequester and store as much carbon as seagrass meadows elsewhere, climate policy incentives should still be implemented to protect existing sediment carbon stocks and the other critical ecosystem services associated with eelgrass habitats.},

We investigated whether populations of several parasites have shifted over time in two shore crab hosts, Hemigrapsus oregonensis and Hemigrapsus nudus, by comparing the prevalence and abundance of three parasite taxa in a historical dataset (1969–1970) to contemporary parasite abundance (2018–2020) for hosts collected from 11 intertidal sites located from Oregon, USA, to British Columbia, Canada. Our data suggest that the abundance of the parasitic isopod Portunion conformis has varied around a stable mean for the past 50 years. No change over time was observed for larval acanthocephalans. However, larval microphallid trematodes increased in prevalence over time among H. oregonensis hosts, from a mean of 8.4–61.8\% between the historical and contemporary time points. The substantial increase in the prevalence of larval microphallid trematodes could be owing to increased abundances of their bird final hosts, increased production of parasite infective stages by snail intermediate hosts or both. Our study highlights the variability among parasite species in their temporal trajectories of change.},

  abstract = {The role that open-net-pen farms for Atlantic Salmon Salmo salar play in the global decline of stocks of wild salmonids (Salmo spp. and Oncorhynchus spp.) is contentious; Canada’s west coast is no exception. We identified the proportion of acoustic-tagged juvenile Sockeye Salmon Oncorhynchus nerka migrating through the main migration routes of the Discovery Islands region of British Columbia and measured both residence time in a major waterway hosting several Atlantic Salmon farms and exposure times to individual farms. One-third of tagged fish migrated through this channel, with median residence times of 32.6 h in 2017 and 46.0 h in 2018. The median time near individual farms was 4.4 min in 2017 when farms were fallow and 10.9 min in 2018 when farms were stocked. The increase in 2018 was probably not caused by farm activity because the proportion of total time spent in the channel was the same across years. Sockeye Salmon used all major migration pathways, but the lack of farms and rapid migration speeds in the westernmost passage offers the lowest potential exposure to fish farms. These are the first individual-level data available to inform assessments of the transmission risk of infectious agents from farms to wild salmonids.},

We observed this strategy in wintering Harlequin Ducks (Histrionicus histrionicus) scavenging fragments of Red Sea Urchins (Mesocentrotus franciscanus) from foraging Sea Otters (Enhydra lutris) that were re-occupying an area from which they had been ecologically absent since about 1850. Harlequin Ducks, like other sea ducks, have not previously been reported scavenging from other birds or mammals. In British columbia, Red Sea Urchins have reached large sizes and densities since the removal of Sea Otter predators by the marine fur trade in the 18th and 19th centuries. Observations of Sea Otters and Harlequin Ducks were made in 4 areas, spanning a time gradient of Sea Otter occupation from 1 to 5 years. During 3 months of observations (December 2013 – February 2014), Harlequin Ducks were associated with foraging Sea Otters only at sites that were recently occupied by Sea Otters (≤ 2 months), where the proportion of urchins in Sea Otter diets was highest and where the ducks acquired urchin fragments from foraging Sea Otters. We suggest that Sea Otters re-occupying their historic range and consuming predominantly large Red Sea Urchins provide a temporarily available prey subsidy for Harlequin Ducks. Our observations document a novel effect of Sea Otters providing important prey supplementation to a marine bird when foraging in urchin-rich habitats, contributing to the overall role of Sea Otters as a keystone species.},

Such linkages are often driven by increases in primary production caused by apex predators limiting herbivores. In this note, we describe a novel linkage among sea otters (Enhydra lutris), the long-lived woody kelp (Pterygophora californica), and bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus). While counting sea otters in an isolated group of rocky islets on the Central Coast of British Columbia, we found an eagle nest composed of mostly Pterygophora stalks. Pterygophora recruits rapidly after sea otters arrive in an area and limit sea urchins; the subsequent pulsed Pterygophora recruitment results in narrow age-class cohorts that senesce en masse after about 20 yr. When the woody stipes wash ashore, they degrade slowly and persist as beach wrack for years. These windrows of woody kelp are common on the BC coast where sea otters have re-established. We demonstrate how this subsidy can be used by bald eagles, and predict that as sea otters recover across their range in BC, further effects of Pterygophora to intertidal, supralittoral, and terrestrial communities will be observed.},

We used a space-for-time substitution to make foraging observations of sea otters (Enhydra lutris) across a gradient of reoccupation time (1–30 years), and nonmetric multidimensional scaling (nMDS) analysis to ask whether (a) sea otter niche space varies as a function of occupation time and (b) whether niche space varies by sex. We found that niche space varied among areas of different occupation times. Dietary niches at short occupation times were dominated by urchins (Mesocentrotus and Strongylocentrotus spp; {$>$}60\% of diets) in open habitats at 10–40 m depths. At longer occupation times, niches were dominated by small clams (Veneroida; {$>$}30\% diet), mussels (Mytilus spp; {$>$}20\% diet), and crab (Decapoda; {$>$}10\% diet) in shallow ({$<$}10 m) kelp habitats. Diet diversity was lowest (H′ = 1.46) but energy rich ( 37 kcal/min) at the earliest occupied area and highest, but energy poor (H′ = 2.63, 9 kcal/min) at the longest occupied area. A similar transition occurred through time at a recently occupied area. We found that niche space also differed between sexes, with bachelor males consuming large clams ({$>$}60\%), and urchins ( 25\%) from deep waters ({$>$}40 m), and females and territorial males consuming smaller, varied prey from shallow waters ({$<$}10 m). Bachelor male diets were less diverse (H′ = 2.21) but more energy rich ( 27 kcal/min) than territorial males (H′ = 2.54, 13 kcal/min) and females (H′ = 2.74, 11 kcal/min). Given recovering predators require adequate food and space, and the ecological interactions they elicit, we emphasize the importance of investigating niche space over the duration of recovery and considering sex-based differences in these interactions.},

Despite several important studies, Indigenous fisheries generally receive less attention from scholars and managers than the 17th–20th century capitalist commercial fisheries that decimated many keystone species, including oysters. We investigate Indigenous oyster harvest through time in North America and Australia, placing these data in the context of sea level histories and historical catch records. Indigenous oyster fisheries were pervasive across space and through time, persisting for 5000–10,000 years or more. Oysters were likely managed and sometimes “farmed,” and are woven into broader cultural, ritual, and social traditions. Effective stewardship of oyster reefs and other marine fisheries around the world must center Indigenous histories and include Indigenous community members to co-develop more inclusive, just, and successful strategies for restoration, harvest, and management.},

To quantify the influence of spawning salmon on tree-ring signatures, we analyzed 543 rings from the heartwood of 13 old-growth Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carrière) trees from five geographically separated watersheds in coastal British Columbia. In comparison with adjacent control trees, those receiving salmon nutrients (salmon trees) have rings that are, on average, 1.5 mm wider, 4.5‰ more enriched in isotopic nitrogen, and 0.021\% more elevated in total nitrogen (P {$<$} 0.001, Mann–Whitney–Wilcoxon test). In this study, salmon nutrients enhance average stem growth by 19\%. Furthermore, salmon trees show that increases in tree-ring width and nitrogen values lag sporadic, high salmon runs by 0 to 5 years. Using differences between control and salmon trees from the same site, our results collectively indicate that tree-ring width, isotopic nitrogen, and total nitrogen are valid, complementary tools for investigating historic, annual fluctuations in salmon abundance in coastal watersheds. We recommend their use in future, tree ring based reconstructions of past nutrient cycling over decadal to centennial time scales.},

The range of N and δ15N values within rings (intra-annual level) was on average equal to or up to seven-times the range among rings (inter-annual level).

By contrast, intra-annual changes in δ15N values were highly variable among years and among trees, ranging from pronounced oscillations (4.0‰) to reasonable consistency.

First, we apply a summed probability distribution model to the dataset; this model indicates that populations generally increased over the Holocene with a significant rise ∼800–600years ago. We then divide our data into 250-year periods and classify each site based on the number of houses, as a large settlement, small settlement, or camp for every period. We observe that the relative numbers of these site types fluctuate through time, and hypothesize that the larger fluctuations indicate changing patterns of social aggregation and dispersal, and settlement abandonment and reoccupation. Through time we see an increase in the number of sites overall, but with considerable variation in the relative number of site types. We see an underlying stability in settlement organization indicative of long-term cultural continuity and place-based identities linked to both specific sites and general locations within the region.},

They are frequently identified in coastal archaeological sites in western North America; however, the morphological similarity of rockfish species limits conventional zooarchaeological identifications to the genus level. This study applies ancient DNA analysis to 96 archaeological rockfish specimens from four sites on separate islands in an archipelago on western Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada. Two of the archaeological sites are located within a marine protected area specifically designed to facilitate the recovery of inshore rockfish populations; two sites are located outside this boundary and remain subject to considerable fishing pressure. Using mitochondrial 16S and control region DNA sequences, we identify at least twelve different rockfish species utilized during the past 2,500 years. Identification of rockfish at closely spaced and contemporaneously occupied sites confirms that a variety of Sebastes species were consistently exploited at each site, with more exposed areas having a higher number of species present. Identification results indicate that four of the twelve species did not occur within the conservation area boundary and, instead, were found in sites where commercial and recreational fishing continues to be permitted. This study demonstrates that ancient DNA identifications of archaeological assemblages can complement and expand perspective on modern day fisheries conservation and management in this National Park Reserve and First Nations ancestral territory.},

Temperature, salinity, and oxygen data were collected monthly in the upper 50 m at three stations in Herbert Inlet from June 2020 to July 2021, marking the first time series of its kind in a Clayoquot Sound fjord. Hypoxic conditions were shallowest (minimum depth of 12 m) and most intensified in summer; near-surface hypoxia was recorded at one or more stations in all months except in winter. Considering that many local marine species, including wild Pacific salmon, experience adverse effects at oxygen concentrations much higher than the hypoxic threshold, we note that 50 to 100\% of the upper 50 m of Herbert Inlet consistently presented low oxygen concentrations (defined here as a guideline as ≤ 4.9 mL L-1 or 6.9 mg L-1) during the 14-month study period. Previous observations collected sporadically since May 1959 confirmed the presence of hypoxic conditions in the past. These findings suggest that long-term, multidisciplinary studies are needed to understand and predict the impact of hypoxia and deoxygenation on wild salmon stocks as climate changes.},

  abstract = {As ocean acidification (OA) sensor technology develops and improves, in situ deployment of such sensors is becoming more widespread. However, the scientific value of these data depends on the development and application of best practices for calibration, validation, and quality assurance as well as on further development and optimization of the measurement technologies themselves. Here, we summarize the results of a 2-day workshop on OA sensor best practices held in February 2018, in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada, drawing on the collective experience and perspectives of the participants. The workshop on in situ Sensors for OA Research was organized around three basic questions: 1) What are the factors limiting the precision, accuracy and reliability of sensor data? 2) What can we do to facilitate the quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) process and optimize the utility of these data? and 3) What sort of data or metadata are needed for these data to be most useful to future users? A synthesis of the discussion of these questions among workshop participants and conclusions drawn is presented in this paper.},

  abstract = {Identifying how past human actions have influenced their environment is essential for understanding the ecological factors that structure contemporary ecosystems. Intertidal resource use by Indigenous Peoples for thousands of years has led to habitation sites containing vast shell midden deposits and facilitating long-term impacts on soil chemistry and drainage. Here we examine how these shell middens have impacted various forest metrics, such as species diversity, community composition, canopy height, and regeneration recruitment to determine if forests on habitation sites differ from the surrounding matrix. We surveyed known habitation sites with archeological evidence indicating past year-round human occupation, within the Hakai Lúxvbálís Conservancy on Calvert and Hecate Islands within the Great Bear Rainforest along British Columbia’s Central Coast. Our results demonstrate that habitation sites exhibit lower tree species richness, less relative species abundances, as such, displayed lower Shannon diversity and inverse Simpson values. The composition of tree communities on habitation sites was statistically different, with western hemlock and western redcedar densities increasing on non-habitation sites. Conversely, regeneration diversity at habitation sites was more even and exhibited elevated Shannon diversity and inverse Simpson values. The community composition of regeneration was more consistent among habitation and non-habitation sites; however, western redcedar, western hemlock and Sitka spruce were more abundant at habitation sites. For all tree species, maximum height was higher within the habitation sites; however, this trend was the most notable in western redcedar and Sitka spruce, which increased by an average of 4.8 m relative to non-habitation sites. Collectively, our findings suggest that long-term habitation alters forest community compositions. The landscape alterations within habitation sites promote conditions needed to support diverse, even, and abundant regeneration communities and consequently increase the height of the dominant coastal tree species. Thus, our results offer evidence that long-term influence by Indigenous communities have a persistent influence on coastal forests.},

Here, we present a novel use of size-spectra analysis to infer nursery habitat function across the estuary habitat mosaic. Interpreting slope and intercept values of abundance against body mass size-spectra regressions as indicators of predation risk and production, we constructed spectra for six distinct habitat types across the entire tidal influence of an unindustrialized estuary in coastal British Columbia. Based on catches of {$>$}200,000 individual fish representing 30 different species from April through September, the estuary rockweed mudflat habitat had the lowest size-spectra slope and highest intercept, consistent with lower predation risk and higher production. Size-spectra coefficients varied seasonally across the ecotone, indicating spatio-temporal variation in key nursery functions. Size-spectra can provide insight into key ecological processes of productivity and predation risk across dynamic aquatic habitats.},

However, occurrence data used to define distributional limits derived from scientific approaches are often outdated for wide ranging and elusive species, especially in remote environments. Accordingly, our aim was to amalgamate indigenous and western scientific evidence of grizzly bear (Ursus arctos horribilis) records and detail a potential range shift on the central coast of British Columbia, Canada. In addition, we test the hypothesis that data from each method yield similar results, as well as illustrate the complementary nature of this coupled approach. Combining information from traditional and local ecological knowledge (TEK/LEK) interviews with remote camera, genetic, and hunting data revealed that grizzly bears are now present on 10 islands outside their current management boundary. LEK interview data suggested this expansion has accelerated over the last 10 years. Both approaches provided complementary details and primarily affirmed one another: all islands with scientific evidence for occupation had consistent TEK/LEK evidence. Moreover, our complementary methods approach enabled a more spatially and temporally detailed account than either method would have afforded alone. In many cases, knowledge already held by local indigenous people could provide timely and inexpensive data about changing ecological processes. However, verifying the accuracy of scientific and experiential knowledge by pairing sources at the same spatial scale allows for increased confidence and detail. A similarly coupled approach may be useful across taxa in many regions.},

Interspecific diversity among Pacific salmon species (Oncorhynchus spp.) creates staggered spawning events across space and time, thereby prolonging availability to terrestrial wildlife. We sought to understand how such variation might influence consumption by terrestrial predators compared with resource abundance and intra- and interspecific competition. Using stable isotope analysis, we investigated how the proportion of salmon in the annual diet of male black bears (Ursus americanus; n = 405) varies with species diversity and density of spawning salmon biomass, while also accounting for competition with sympatric black and grizzly bears (U. arctos horribilis), in coastal British Columbia, Canada. We found that the proportion of salmon in the annual diet of black bears was ≈40\% higher in the absence of grizzly bears, but detected little effect of relative black bear density and salmon biomass density. Rather, salmon diversity had the largest positive effect on consumption. On average, increasing diversity from one salmon species to four (with equal biomass contributions) approximately triples the proportion of salmon in diet. Given the importance of salmon to bear life histories, this work provides early empirical support for how resource waves may increase the productivity of consumers at population and landscape scales. Accordingly, terrestrial wildlife management might consider maintaining not only salmon abundance but also diversity.},

  abstract = {Ecosystem restoration is the practice of assisting recovery in degraded ecological communities. The aims of restoration are typically broad, involving the reinstatement of composition, structure, function, and resilience to disturbances. One common restoration tactic in degraded urban systems is to control invasive species, relying on passive restoration for further ecosystem-level recovery. Here, we test whether this is an effective restoration strategy in Garry oak savanna, a highly threatened and ecologically important community in the North American Pacific Northwest. In urban savanna patches surrounding Victoria, British Columbia, community members have been actively removing aggressive invasive exotic species for over a decade. Based on vegetation surveys from 2007, we tested ecosystem changes in structure, composition, and resilience (i.e., functional redundancy and response diversity) across 10 years of varied management levels. We expected higher levels of invasive species management would correspond with improvements to these ecosystem metrics. However, management explained little of the patterns found over the 10-year-period. Woody encroachment was a complicated process of native and exotic invasion, while resilience and compositional changes were most closely tied with landscape connectivity. Thus, though invasive species management may prevent further degradation, active restoration strategies after removal are likely required for recovery of the ecosystem.},

At the Last Glacial Maximum, the Cordilleran Ice Sheet depressed the crust over which it formed and created a raised forebulge along peripheral areas offshore. This, combined with different tectonic settings along the coast, resulted in divergent relative sea-level responses during the Holocene. For example, sea level was up to 200~m higher than present in the lower Fraser Valley region of southwest British Columbia, due largely to isostatic depression. At the same time, sea level was 150~m lower than present in Haida Gwaii, on the northern coast of British Columbia, due to the combined effects of the forebulge raising the land and lower eustatic sea level. A forebulge also developed in parts of southeast Alaska resulting in post-glacial sea levels at least 122~m lower than present and possibly as low as 165~m. On the coasts of Washington and Oregon, as well as south-central Alaska, neotectonics and eustasy seem to have played larger roles than isostatic adjustments in controlling relative sea-level changes.},

Archaeological research has predominantly focused on evaluating the dietary contribution of Mytilus but most studies assume an average meat weight or use categorical size classifications to determine subsistence strategies and harvest profiles. In this paper, we develop and evaluate a regression-based method for estimating shell length and meat weight for fragmentary Mytilus remains. Our regressions are based on live-collected M. californianus specimens from multiple locations in California and British Columbia and provide considerable statistical confidence for predicting length and meat weight. We also apply the same regressions to a collection of Mytilus trossulus and show similar predictive equations, indicating this method can be used in cases where it is not possible to distinguish morphologically between M.~californianus and M.~trossulus. We demonstrate how these results improve upon previous size-classification methods and discuss the potential for applying these measurements to enhance the relevance of these zooarchaeological data for modern marine conservation and management efforts.},

Today, the conservation status of sea otters is informed by estimates of population carrying capacity or growth rates independent of human impacts. However, archaeological and ethnographic evidence suggests that for millennia, complex hunting and management protocols by Indigenous communities limited sea otter abundance near human settlements to reduce the negative impacts of this keystone predator on shared shellfish prey. To assess relative sea otter prevalence in the Holocene, we compared the size structure of ancient California mussels (Mytilus californianus) from six archaeological sites in two regions on the Pacific Northwest Coast, to modern California mussels at locations with and without sea otters. We also quantified modern mussel size distributions from eight locations on the Central Coast of British Columbia, Canada, varying in sea otter occupation time. Comparisons of mussel size spectra revealed that ancient mussel size distributions are consistently more similar to modern size distributions at locations with a prolonged absence of sea otters. This indicates that late Holocene sea otters were maintained well below carrying capacity near human settlements as a result of human intervention. These findings illuminate the conditions under which sea otters and humans persisted over millennia prior to the Pacific maritime fur trade and raise important questions about contemporary conservation objectives for an iconic marine mammal and the social-ecological system in which it is embedded.},

  abstract = {Ancient systems of mariculture were foundations of social-ecological systems of many coastal Indigenous Peoples. However, since such systems either do not leave tangible remains in the archaeological record, and/or are hard to date, we know little about their development and use. Clam gardens, traditional mariculture features located within the intertidal zone along the Northwest Coast of North America, are composed of a rock wall positioned at the low tide mark and a flattened terrace on the landward side of the wall. Because these features are largely composed of rock and sediment, and have complex formation histories, they can be difficult to age. On northern Quadra Island, British Columbia, we identify three variations in clam garden form, constructed in different geomorphological settings, each of which require different sampling approaches to obtain ages on construction and ongoing use. To age the clam gardens, we consider radiocarbon dating of invertebrates that inhabit beach deposits (both pre- and post-garden construction), and the relationship of the gardens and clam samples to the local sea level history and taphonomic processes. Within our study area, we find clam gardens have been in use for 3500 years, likely corresponding to other social and ecological changes of the time. These data allow us to formulate guidelines on samples most suitable to constrain the age of initial and on-going wall construction and use of clam gardens, which can be extrapolated to dating other ancient mariculture features in other regions. Such dating programs are the foundation for understanding the long-term development of traditional marine management practices and how they are situated in broader social-ecological systems.},

  abstract = {High-resolution measurements of the air-ice-ocean system during an October 2015 event in the Beaufort Sea demonstrate how stored ocean heat can be released to temporarily reverse seasonal ice advance. Strong on-ice winds over a vast fetch caused mixing and release of heat from the upper ocean. This heat was sufficient to melt large areas of thin, newly formed pancake ice; an average of 10 MJ/m2 was lost from the upper ocean in the study area, resulting in ∼3–5 cm pancake sea ice melt. Heat and salt budgets create a consistent picture of the evolving air-ice-ocean system during this event, in both a fixed and ice-following (Lagrangian) reference frame. The heat lost from the upper ocean is large compared with prior observations of ocean heat flux under thick, multiyear Arctic sea ice. In contrast to prior studies, where almost all heat lost goes into ice melt, a significant portion of the ocean heat released in this event goes directly to the atmosphere, while the remainder (∼30–40\%) goes into melting sea ice. The magnitude of ocean mixing during this event may have been enhanced by large surface waves, reaching nearly 5 m at the peak, which are becoming increasingly common in the autumn Arctic Ocean. The wave effects are explored by comparing the air-ice-ocean evolution observed at short and long fetches, and a common scaling for Langmuir turbulence. After the event, the ocean mixed layer was deeper and cooler, and autumn ice formation resumed.},

  abstract = {In coastal regions, rivers and streams may be important sources of nutrients limiting to primary production in marine waters; however, sampling is still rarely conducted across the land-to-ocean aquatic continuum, precluding conclusions from being drawn about connectivity between freshwater and marine systems. Here we use a more-than-4-year dataset (2014–2018) of nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, silica, iron) and dissolved organic carbon spanning streams draining coastal watersheds and nearshore marine surface waters along the Central Coast of British Columbia, Canada, at the heart of the North Pacific coastal temperate rainforest region. Mean freshwater and surface marine N:Si:P ratios were 5:20:1 (P:Fe = 1:67) and 6:11:1, respectively, showing relative consistency across the land–ocean interface but deviation from the extended Redfield ratio. Inorganic nutrient concentrations (NO3-+NO2-, PO43-, Si(OH)4) in fresh waters were less than in the receiving marine environment, indicating that freshwater nutrient inputs in this region were of little importance to – or even diluted – the pool of readily available inorganic nutrients in nearshore waters. Conversely, fresh waters increased the pool of organic-matter-associated nutrients, namely dissolved organic nitrogen and iron. The organic-matter-rich landscapes of the region yielded globally significant quantities of dissolved organic nitrogen (304–381 kg km−2 yr−1) and iron (463–596 kg km−2 yr−1), thus acting as important sources of potentially limiting nutrients to both nearshore and offshore waters. These exports may subsidise heterotrophic microbial communities capable of directly consuming and remineralising these nutrients, potentially compensating for the dilution of inorganic nutrients by freshwater inputs. We highlight the need to better understand nutrient limitation in coastal waters and for concerted research efforts to study the spatial and temporal dynamism at the land–ocean interface along the northeast Pacific coast.},

  abstract = {Globally, coastal waters are considered biogeochemical hotspots because they receive, transform, and integrate materials and waters from both land and the open ocean. Extending from northern California to southeast Alaska, the Northeast Pacific Coastal Temperate Rainforest (NPCTR) region is no exception to this, and hosts a diversity of watershed types (old-growth rainforest, bog forest, glaciers), and tidal (sheltered, exposed) and pelagic marine (deep fjord, shallow estuary, well-mixed channel) environments. With large freshwater fluxes to the coastal ocean, cross-ecosystem connectivity in the NPCTR is expected to be high, but seasonally variable, with pulses in runoff from rainfall, snowmelt and glacial melt, and primary production associated with changes in ocean upwelling and incident light. However, the relative contribution of each ecosystem to surface ocean organic matter pools over time and space remains poorly constrained, despite their importance for the structure and function of coastal marine ecosystems. Here, we use a four-year dataset of particulate organic matter (POM) chemical composition (δ13C, δ15N, C:N ratio) to quantify the relative contributions of watershed materials via riverine inputs, marine phytoplankton, and macrophytes (macroalgae and seagrass) to surface waters (0-10~m) at 11 stations representing fjord, shallow non-fjord estuary, sheltered channel and well-mixed coastal environments at the heart of the NPCTR in British Columbia, Canada. Watershed, marine phytoplankton, and macrophyte contributions to surficial POM ranged between 5-78\%, 22-88\%, and 0.1-18\%, respectively, and varied by season and station. Watershed inputs were the primary source of POM across all stations in winter and were important throughout the year within the fjord. Marine phytoplankton were the principal source of POM in spring and at all stations outside of the fjord through summer and autumn, while macrophyte contributions were greatest in summer. These results demonstrated high, but seasonally and spatially variable, connectivity between ecosystems that are often considered in isolation of one another and highlight the need to consider coastal waters as integrated land-ocean meta-ecosystems. Future work should investigate how heterogeneity in POM sources determines its fate in coastal ecosystems,and the relative importance of different basal organic matter sources for the marine food web.},

  abstract = {Biomass allocation patterns have received substantial consideration, leading to the recognition of several ‘universal’ interspecific trends. Despite efforts to understand biomass partitioning among embryophytes, few studies have examined macroalgae that evolved independently, yet function ecologically in much the same ways as plants. Kelps allocate photosynthate among three organs (the blade(s), stipe(s) and holdfast) that are superficially convergent with organs of land plants, providing a unique opportunity to test the limits of ‘universal’ trends. In this study, we used an allometric approach to quantify interspecific biomass partitioning patterns in kelps and assess whether embryophyte-based predictions of biomass scaling can be applied to marine macrophytes that lack root-to-leaf hydraulic transport. Photosynthetic area and dry mass were found to scale to approximately the ¾ power and kelp biomass allocation patterns were shown to match closely to empirical measures of allometric scaling among woody plants. Larger kelp species were found to have increased relative stipe and holdfast mass than smaller species, highlighting important consequences of size for marine macroalgae. Our study provides insights into the evolution of size in the largest marine macrophytes and corroborates previous work suggesting that the morphology of divergent lineages of photoautotrophs may reflect similar selective pressures.},

Metacommunity ecology provides a framework for understanding how these processes combine to determine community seagrass meadows along the British Columbia coast. We tested the hypothesis that eelgrass Zostera marina L. epifaunal invertebrate assemblages are influenced by local environmental conditions but that high dispersal rates at larger spatial scales dampen the effects of environmental differences. We used hierarchical joint species distribution modelling to understand the contribution of environmental conditions, spatial distance between meadows, and species co-occurrences to epifaunal invertebrate abundance and distribution across the region. We found that patterns of taxonomic compositional similarity among meadows were inconsistent with dispersal limitation, and meadows in the same region were often no more similar to each other than meadows over 1000 km away. Abiotic environmental conditions (temperature, dissolved oxygen) explained a small fraction of variation in taxonomic abundance patterns across the region. We found novel co-occurrence patterns among taxa that could not be explained by shared responses to environmental gradients, suggesting the possibility that interspecific interactions influence seagrass invertebrate abundance and distribution. Our results suggest that biodiversity and ecosystem functions provided by seagrass meadows reflect ecological processes occurring both within meadows and across seascapes and that management of eelgrass habitat for biodiversity may be most effective when both local and regional processes are considered.},

Differences in simulated Chl-a are caused by large intermodel differences in available nitrate in the Arctic Ocean and to some extent by ecosystem complexity. Most models reproduce the observed SCM and nitracline deepening and indicate a continued deepening in the future until the models reach a new state with seasonal ice-free waters. Models not representing a SCM show either too much nitrate and hence no surface limitation or too little nitrate with limited surface growth only. The models suggest that suppression of the nitracline and deepening of the SCM are caused by enhanced stratification, likely driven by enhanced Ekman convergence and freshwater contributions with primarily large-scale atmospheric driving mechanisms. The simulated ratio of near-surface Chl-a to depth-integrated Chl-a is slightly decreasing in most areas of the Arctic Ocean due to enhanced contributions of subsurface Chl-a. Exceptions are some shelf areas and regions where the continued ice thinning leaves winter ice too thin to provide a barrier to momentum fluxes, allowing winter mixing to break up the strong stratification. Results confirm that algorithms determining vertically integrated Chl-a from surface Chl-a need to be tuned to Arctic conditions, but likely require little or no adjustments in the future.},

  abstract = {Predation can influence the magnitude of herbivory that grazers exert on primary producers by altering both grazer abundance and their per capita consumption rates via changes in behavior, density-dependent effects, and size. Therefore, models based solely on changes in abundance may miss key components of grazing pressure. We estimated shifts in grazing pressure associated with changes in the abundance and per capita consumption rates of sea urchins triggered by size-selective predation by sea otters (Enhydra lutris). Field surveys suggest that sea otters dramatically decreased the abundance and median size of sea urchins. Furthermore, laboratory experiments revealed that kelp consumption by sea urchins varied nonlinearly as a function of urchin size such that consumption rates increased to the 0.56 and 0.68 power of biomass for red and green urchins, respectively. This reveals that shifts in urchin size structure due to size-selective predation by sea otters alter sea urchin per capita grazing rates. Comparison of two quantitative models estimating total consumptive capacity revealed that a model incorporating shifts in urchin abundance while neglecting urchin size structure overestimated grazing pressure compared to a model that incorporated size. Consequently, incorporating shifts in urchin size better predicted field estimates of kelp abundance compared to equivalent models based on urchin abundance alone. We provide strong evidence that incorporating size-specific parameters increases our ability to describe and predict trophic interactions.},

The federal government, academia, small businesses, not-for-profit organizations, and other research partners, collect and synthesize physical, chemical and biological observations for research purposes, to model ocean changes, to support resource management decision-making, and to establish baseline data for long-term monitoring. Aside from building comprehensive ocean observatories (Fisheries and Oceans Canada, 2010), there is no easy mechanism to integrate the large amounts of data from the various sources or to explore interrelationships among variables, and no coordination and collaboration mechanism for the ocean community as a whole to generate an efficient system Ocean Science and Technology Partnership (OSTP), for Fisheries and Oceans Canada (2011). Consequently, we observe fragmented and isolated data that is only discoverable by a limited range of end users. Canada’s ocean science community (Wallace et al., 2014), led and supported by Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO), is developing a Canadian Integrated Ocean Observation System (CIOOS) that brings together and leverages existing Canadian and international ocean observation data into a federated data system. This system (Wilson et al., 2016) will improve coordination and collaboration among diverse data producers, improve access to information for decision making, and enable discovery and access to data to support a wide variety of applied and theoretical research efforts to better understand, monitor, and manage activities in Canada’s oceans. Canada is implementing a CIOOS test-phase, which will eventually lead to the development of a robust and integrated observing system, improving connections between end users and providers of ocean observations. The improved coordination of regional and national efforts within CIOOS will contribute to global ocean observing, maximizing the overall benefit of integrated observing.},

Warming temperatures, freshening seawater, and disruption to sea-ice formation potentially all have cascading effects on food webs. New approaches are needed to better understand spatiotemporal interactions among biogeochemical processes at the base of Southern Ocean food webs. In marine systems, isoscapes (models of the spatial variation in the stable isotopic composition) of carbon and nitrogen have proven useful in identifying spatial variation in a range of biogeochemical processes, such as nutrient utilization by phytoplankton. Isoscapes provide a baseline for interpreting stable isotope compositions of higher trophic level animals in movement, migration, and diet research. Here, we produce carbon and nitrogen isoscapes across the entire Southern Ocean ({$>$}40°S) using surface particulate organic matter isotope data, collected over the past 50 years. We use Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation-based approaches to predict mean annual isoscapes and four seasonal isoscapes using a suite of environmental data as predictor variables. Clear spatial gradients in δ13C and δ15N values were predicted across the Southern Ocean, consistent with previous statistical and mechanistic views of isotopic variability in this region. We identify strong seasonal variability in both carbon and nitrogen isoscapes, with key implications for the use of static or annual average isoscape baselines in animal studies attempting to document seasonal migratory or foraging behaviors.},

This operationally inexpensive method builds upon variable microelement concentrations in fresh- and saltwater environments: barium (Ba) and strontium (Sr) concentrations within the sockeye otoliths differed between the freshwater and seawater growth zones; Ba concentrations in the freshwater growth zone were significantly higher than those in the seawater growth zone, while Sr concentrations in the former were significantly lower than in the latter. The concentrations of these elements within otoliths were determined quantitatively at high spatial resolution using in situ laser ablation inductively coupled with a plasma mass spectrometer (ICPMS) providing a record of the ambient environmental conditions experienced by individual fish.

We used an Ecopath with Ecosim ecosystem model parameterized for northern British Columbia (Canada), employing Ecosim to simulate ecosystem effects of herring stock collapse. The ecological impacts of various herring fishing strategies were investigated with a Management Strategy Evaluation algorithm within Ecosim, accounting for variability in climatic drivers and stock assessment errors. Ecosim results suggest that herring stock collapse would have cascading impacts on much of the pelagic food web. Management Strategy Evaluation results indicate that herring and their predators suffer moderate impacts from the existing British Columbia harvest control rule, although more precautionary management strategies could substantially reduce these impacts. The non-capture spawn-on-kelp fishery, traditionally practiced by many British Columbia and Alaska indigenous peoples, apparently has extremely limited ecological impacts. Our simulations also suggest that adopting a maximum sustainable yield management strategy in Northeast Pacific herring fisheries could generate strong, cascading food web effects. Furthermore, climate shifts, especially when combined with herring stock assessment errors, could strongly reduce the biomasses and resilience of herring and its predators. By clarifying the trophic role of Pacific herring, this study aims to facilitate precautionary fisheries management via evaluation of alternative fishing strategies, and thereby to inform policy tradeoffs among multiple ecological and socioeconomic factors.},

These current approaches provide the information needed for forest ecosystem management but constrain the thematic and spatial resolution of mapping and are infrequently repeated. The goal of this research was to demonstrate the utility of an unsupervised, quantitative technique based on Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) data and multi-spectral satellite imagery for mapping local-scale ecosystems over a heterogeneous landscape of forested and non-forested ecosystems. We derived a range of metrics characterizing local terrain and vegetation from LiDAR and RapidEye imagery for Calvert and Hecate Islands, British Columbia. These metrics were used in a cluster analysis to classify and quantitatively characterize ecological units across the island. A total of 18 clusters were derived. The clusters were attributed with quantitative summary statistics from the remotely sensed data inputs and contextualized through comparison to ecological units delineated in a traditional expert-driven mapping method using aerial photographs. The 18 clusters describe ecosystems ranging from open shrublands to dense, productive forest and include a riparian zone and many wetter and wetland ecosystems. The clusters provide detailed, spatially-explicit information for characterizing the landscape as a mosaic of units defined by topography and vegetation structure. This study demonstrates that using various types of remotely sensed data in a quantitative classification can provide scientists and managers with multivariate information unique from that which results from traditional, expert-based ecosystem mapping methods.},

  abstract = {Kelp forests are commonly classified within remote sensing imagery by contrasting the high reflectance in the near-infrared spectral region of kelp canopy floating at the surface with the low reflectance in the same spectral region of water. However, kelp canopy is often submerged below the surface of the water, making it important to understand the effects of kelp submersion on the above-water reflectance of kelp, and the depth to which kelp can be detected, in order to reduce uncertainties around the kelp canopy area when mapping kelp. Here, we characterized changes to the above-water spectra of Nereocystis luetkeana (Bull kelp) as different canopy structures (bulb and blades) were submerged in water from the surface to 100 cm in 10 cm increments, while collecting above-water hyperspectral measurements with a spectroradiometer (325–1075 nm). The hyperspectral data were simulated into the multispectral bandwidths of the WorldView-3 satellite and the Micasense RedEdge-MX unoccupied aerial vehicle sensors and vegetation indices were calculated to compare detection limits of kelp with a focus on differences between red edge and near infrared indices. For kelp on the surface, near-infrared reflectance was higher than red-edge reflectance. Once submerged, the kelp spectra showed two narrow reflectance peaks in the red-edge and near-infrared wavelength ranges, and the red-edge peak was consistently higher than the near-infrared peak. As a result, kelp was detected deeper with vegetation indices calculated with a red-edge band versus those calculated with a near infrared band. Our results show that using red-edge bands increased detection of submerged kelp canopy, which may be beneficial for estimating kelp surface-canopy area and biomass.},

  abstract = {Historical ecology can provide insights into the long-term and complex relationships between humans and culturally important species and ecosystems, thereby extending baselines for modern management. We bring together paleoecological, archaeological, and modern clam records to explore the relationship between humans and butter clams (Saxidomus gigantea) throughout the Holocene in the northern Salish Sea of British Columbia, Canada. We compare butter clam size and growth patterns from different temporal, environmental, and cultural contexts spanning 11,500 y to present. Butter clam size and growth were restricted in early postglacial times but increased over the next few millennia. During the early-Late Holocene, humans took increasing advantage of robust clam populations and after 3.5 ka, began constructing clam gardens (intertidal rock-walled terraces). Environmental and cultural variables, including coarse substrate, stabilized sea surface temperature, and the presence of a clam garden wall, increased clam growth throughout the Holocene. Measurements of clams collected in active clam gardens and deposited in middens suggest that clam gardens as well as other mariculture activities enhanced clam production despite increased harvesting pressure. Since European contact, decline of traditional management practices and increases in industrial activities are associated with reduced clam size and growth similar to those of the early postglacial clams. Deeper-time baselines that more accurately represent clam population variability and allow us to assess magnitudes of change throughout time as well as the complex interactions among humans and clams are useful for modern marine resource management.},

This is particularly the case over the last 6,000 years when intensified intertidal shellfish usage resulted in the accumulation of substantial shell middens. We show that soils at habitation sites are higher in calcium and phosphorous. Both of these are limiting factors in coastal temperate rainforests. Western redcedar (Thuja plicata) trees growing on the middens were found to be taller, have higher wood calcium, greater radial growth and exhibit less top die-back. Coastal British Columbia is the first known example of long-term intertidal resource use enhancing forest productivity and we expect this pattern to occur at archaeological sites along coastlines globally.},

Observing the fates of known individuals is a common method of estimating life history variables, including mortality patterns. It has long been assumed that data lost when known animals disappear were unbiased. We test and reject this assumption under conditions common to most, if not all, studies using marked animals. We illustrate the bias for 4 endangered wolf populations in the United States by reanalyzing data and assumptions about the known and unknown fates of marked wolves to calculate the degree to which risks of different causes of death were mismeasured. We find that, when using traditional methods, the relative risk of mortality from legal killing measured as a proportion of all known fates was overestimated by 0.05–0.16 and the relative risk of poaching was underestimated by 0.17–0.44. We show that published government estimates are affected by these biases and, importantly, are underestimating the risk of poaching. The underestimates have obscured the magnitude of poaching as the major threat to endangered wolf populations. We offer methods to correct estimates of mortality risk for marked animals of any taxon and describe the conditions under which traditional methods produce more or less bias. We also show how correcting past and future estimates of mortality parameters can address uncertainty about wildlife populations and increase the predictability and sustainability of wildlife management interventions.},

We investigated epibiotic microeukaryotes on seagrass (Zostera marina) leaves, substrates, and planktonic microeukaryotes in ten meadows in the Northeast Pacific. Seagrass epibiotic communities are distinct from planktonic and substrate communities. We found sixteen core microeukaryotes, including dinoflagellates, diatoms, and saprotrophic stramenopiles. Some likely use seagrass leaves as a substrate, others for grazing, or they may be saprotrophic organisms involved in seagrass decomposition or parasites; their relatives have been previously reported from marine sediments and in association with other hosts such as seaweeds. Core microeukaryotes were spatially structured, and none were ubiquitous across meadows. Seagrass epibiota were more spatially structured than planktonic communities, mostly due to spatial distance and changes in abiotic conditions across space. Seawater communities were relatively more similar in composition across sites and more influenced by the environmental component, but more variable over time. Core and transient taxa were both mostly structured by spatial distance and the abiotic environment, with little effect of host attributes, further indicating that those core taxa would not show a strong specific association with Z. marina.},

The use of transmembrane chlorophyll complexes instead of phycobilisomes as light-harvesting antennae is considered a defining attribute of Prochlorococcus. Its ecology and evolution are understood in terms of light, temperature, and nutrients. Here, we report single-cell genomic information on previously uncharacterized phylogenetic lineages of this genus from nutrient-rich anoxic waters of the eastern tropical North and South Pacific Ocean. The most basal lineages exhibit optical and genotypic properties of phycobilisome-containing cyanobacteria, indicating that the characteristic light-harvesting antenna of the group is not an ancestral attribute. Additionally, we found that all the indigenous lineages analyzed encode genes for pigment biosynthesis under oxygen-limited conditions, a trait shared with other freshwater and coastal marine cyanobacteria. Our findings thus suggest that Prochlorococcus diverged from other cyanobacteria under low-oxygen conditions before transitioning from phycobilisomes to transmembrane chlorophyll complexes and may have contributed to the oxidation of the ancient ocean.},

A molecular phylogenetic analysis of Trigonostominae and other Thalassotyphloplanida using 18S rRNA and partial 28S rRNA sequences from 42 species demonstrates the phylogenetic positions of the four new species in addition to other inter- and intrageneric relationships within Trigonostominae (e.g. Messoplana is embedded within Ceratopera). This molecular phylogenetic context enables us to reassess homology statements about stylet morphology and the organization of the afferent system within Trigonostominae.},

  abstract = {Increasing evidence suggests that many widespread species of meiofauna are in fact regional complexes of (pseudo-)cryptic species. This knowledge has challenged the ‘Everything is Everywhere’ hypothesis and also partly explains the meiofauna paradox of widespread nominal species with limited dispersal abilities. Here, we investigated species diversity within the marine microturbellarian Astrotorhynchus bifidus sensu lato in the Northeast Pacific Ocean. We used a multiple-evidence approach combining multi-gene (18S, 28S, COI) phylogenetic analyses, several single-gene and multi-gene species delimitation methods, haplotype networks and conventional taxonomy to designate Primary Species Hypotheses (PSHs). This included the development of rhabdocoel-specific COI barcode primers, which also have the potential to aid in species identification and delimitation in other rhabdocoels. Secondary Species Hypotheses (SSHs) corresponding to morphospecies and pseudo-cryptic species were then proposed based on the minimum consensus of different PSHs. Our results showed that (a) there are at least five species in the A. bifidus complex in the Northeast Pacific Ocean, four of which can be diagnosed based on stylet morphology, (b) the A. bifidus complex is a mixture of sympatric and allopatric species with regional and/or subglobal distributions, (c) sympatry occurs on local (sample sites), regional (Northeastern Pacific) and subglobal (Northern Atlantic, Arctic, Northeastern Pacific) scales. Mechanisms for this co-occurrence are still poorly understood, but we hypothesize they could include habitat differentiation (spatial and/or seasonal) and life history characteristics such as sexual selection and dispersal abilities. Our results also suggest the need for improved sampling and exploration of molecular markers to accurately map gene flow and broaden our understanding of species diversity and distribution of microturbellarians in particular and meiofauna in general.},

Based in the empirical setting of British Columbia, Canada, this research examines (1) pressures for change to federal herring policy in the context of Indigenous rights and self-determination, and (2) the compatibility of Canadian federal marine policies with Indigenous herring governance. Findings suggest that Canada has an opportunity to implement new and strategic policy alternatives on herring that: better reflect emergent legal precedents; accommodates gains in Indigenous influence over decision-making; and supports the self-determination goals of coastal Indigenous nations. Given the context of fisheries uncertainty and a clear need to address Indigenous legal and inherent rights, Canada has an opportunity to position itself as a global leader in marine policy to reflect Indigenous inherent and legal rights.},

We quantified the influence of salmon on the abundance and composition of songbird communities across a wide range of salmon-spawning biomass on 14 streams along a remote coastal region of British Columbia, Canada. Point-count data spanning two years were combined with salmon biomass and 13 environmental covariates in riparian forests to test for correlates with bird abundance, foraging guilds, individual species, and avian diversity. We show that bird abundance and diversity increase with salmon biomass and that watershed size and forest composition are less important predictors. This work provides new evidence for the importance of salmon to terrestrial ecosystems and information that can inform ecosystem-based management.},

We provide a comprehensive synthesis of relationships between the densities of Pacific salmon and terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, summarize the direction, shape, and magnitude of these relationships, and identify possible ecosystem-based management indicators and benchmarks. We found 31 studies that provided 172 relationships between salmon density (or salmon abundance) and species abundance, species diversity, food provisioning, individual growth, concentration of marine-derived isotopes, nutrient enhancement, phenology, and several other ecological responses. The most common published relationship was between salmon density and marine-derived isotopes (40\%), whereas very few relationships quantified ecosystem-level responses (5\%). Only 13\% of all relationships tended to reach an asymptote (i.e., a saturating response) as salmon densities increased. The number of salmon killed by bears and the change in biomass of different stream invertebrate taxa between spawning and nonspawning seasons were relationships that usually reached saturation. Approximately 46\% of all relationships were best described with linear or curved nonasymptotic models, indicating a lack of saturation. In contrast, 41\% of data sets showed no relationship with salmon density or abundance, including many of the relationships with stream invertebrate and biofilm biomass density, marine-derived isotope concentrations, or vegetation density. Bears required the highest densities of salmon to reach their maximum observed food consumption (i.e., 9.2 kg/m2 to reach the 90\% threshold of the relationship’s asymptote), followed by freshwater fish abundance (90\% threshold = 7.3 kg/m2 of salmon). Although the effects of salmon density on ecosystems are highly varied, it appears that several of these relationships, such as bear food consumption, could be used to develop indicators and benchmarks for ecosystem-based fisheries management.},

  abstract = {Vertical migrations of zooplankters have been widely described, but their active movements through shallow, highly dynamic water columns within the inner shelf may be more complex and difficult to characterize. In this study, invertebrate larvae, currents, and hydrographic variables were sampled at different depths during and after the presence of fronts on three different cruises off the southern coast of South Africa. Internal wave dynamics were observed in the hydrographic data set but also through satellite imagery, although strong surface convergent currents were absent and thermal stratification was weak. During the first two cruises, fronts were more conspicuous and they preceded strong onshore currents at depth which developed with the rising tide. Vertical distributions of larvae changed accordingly, with higher abundances at these deep layers once the front disappeared. The third cruise was carried out during slack tides, the front was not conspicuous, deep strong onshore currents did not occur afterward and larval distributions did not change consistently through time. Overall, the vertical distributions of many larval taxa matched the vertical profiles of shoreward currents and multivariate analyses revealed that these flows structured the larval community, which was neither influenced by temperature nor chlorophyll. Thus, the ability to regulate active vertical positioning may enhance shoreward advection and determine nearshore larval distributions.},

  abstract = {The global distribution of primary production and consumption by humans (fisheries) is well-documented, but we have no map linking the central ecological process of consumption within food webs to temperature and other ecological drivers. Using standardized assays that span 105° of latitude on four continents, we show that rates of bait consumption by generalist predators in shallow marine ecosystems are tightly linked to both temperature and the composition of consumer assemblages. Unexpectedly, rates of consumption peaked at midlatitudes (25 to 35°) in both Northern and Southern Hemispheres across both seagrass and unvegetated sediment habitats. This pattern contrasts with terrestrial systems, where biotic interactions reportedly weaken away from the equator, but it parallels an emerging pattern of a subtropical peak in marine biodiversity. The higher consumption at midlatitudes was closely related to the type of consumers present, which explained rates of consumption better than consumer density, biomass, species diversity, or habitat. Indeed, the apparent effect of temperature on consumption was mostly driven by temperature-associated turnover in consumer community composition. Our findings reinforce the key influence of climate warming on altered species composition and highlight its implications for the functioning of Earth’s ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Knowledge of how ecocultural landscapes co-evolved, how they were shaped and maintained by local people, and what processes disturbed the landscape should inform the planning, execution, and significance of restoration projects. Indigenous stewardship has resulted in legacies of diverse and productive ecocultural environments. Often, this stewardship has been guided by place-based values, which are informed by Indigenous knowledge, beliefs of equal respect for all ecosystem components, and conduct that sustains resource productivity. We propose that cultivating place-based values in restoration initiatives will provide reciprocal benefits by conserving biodiversity and promoting human connections to land. Drawing on lessons from Indigenous knowledge systems in what is now called British Columbia, Canada, we demonstrate how place-based values directed the stewardship of historical oak-meadow and clam gardens, which created diverse and productive ecosystems that sustained for millennia. Drawing on examples of contemporary restoration projects (crabapple orchards and clam gardens) that utilize place-based values to inform the recovery of ecocultural landscapes, we propose a framework to help initiate a place-based values approach in contemporary restoration design congruent with ethics of inclusion.},

  abstract = {Sea wrack provides an important vector of marine-derived nutrients to many terrestrial environments. However, little is known about the processes that facilitate wrack transport, deposition, and accumulation on islands. Three broad factors can affect the stock of wrack along shorelines: the amount of potential donor habitat nearby, climatic events that dislodge seaweeds and transfer them ashore, and physical characteristics of shorelines that retain wrack at a site. To determine when, where, and how wrack accumulates on island shorelines, we surveyed 455 sites across 101 islands in coastal British Columbia, Canada. At each site, we recorded wrack biomass, species composition, and shoreline biogeographical characteristics. Additionally, over a period of 9 mo, we visited a smaller selection of sites (n = 3) every 2 mo to document temporal changes in wrack biomass and species composition. Dominant wrack species were Zostera marina, Fucus distichus, Macrocystis pyrifera, Nereocystis luetkeana, Pterygophora californica, and Phyllospadix spp. The amount of donor habitat positively affected the presence of accumulated biomass of sea wrack, whereas rocky substrates and shoreline slope negatively affected the presence of sea wrack biomass. Biomass was higher during winter months, and species diversity was higher during summer months. These results suggest that shorelines with specific characteristics have the capacity to accumulate wrack, thereby facilitating the transfer of marine-derived nutrients to the terrestrial environment.},

  abstract = {Macroalgae and seagrasses form the base of productive ecosystems in the Northeastern Pacific Ocean. Often, ecological research on macroalgae, seagrasses, and sea wrack requires the conversion of biomass from wet to dry to create consistency across investigations. This process, however, can be destructive, impractical, time consuming, and labour intensive. We collected samples of twelve common Northeastern Pacific Ocean seaweed species (Alaria marginata, Codium fragile, Egregia menziesii, Fucus distichus, Macrocystis pyrifera, Mazzaella spp., Nereocystis luetkeana, Pterygophora californica, Pyropia spp., Ulva spp., and the seagrasses Zostera marina and Phyllospadix spp.) in two states: wet and fresh, or aged and partially desiccated. We weighed, dried, and compared samples, finding that many species displayed a strong (R2 {$>$} 0.8) and predictable linear relationship between wet and dried conditions. In contrast, half the aged samples did not have a significant relationship between partially desiccated and dried conditions. Our results provide practical wet weight to dry weight ratios for many species, and with further research, a reliable set of species-specific wet to dry weight ratios for all species could be established. Wet to dry weight ratios are useful for macroalgae, seagrass, and sea wrack research or commercial applications and would reduce the need to conduct extensive wet-dry calibrations in each study.},

  abstract = {Unoccupied Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), or drone technologies, with their high spatial resolution, temporal flexibility, and ability to repeat photogrammetry, afford a significant advancement in other remote sensing approaches for coastal mapping, habitat monitoring, and environmental management. However, geographical drone mapping and in situ fieldwork often come with a steep learning curve requiring a background in drone operations, Geographic Information Systems (GIS), remote sensing and related analytical techniques. Such a learning curve can be an obstacle for field implementation for researchers, community organizations and citizen scientists wishing to include introductory drone operations into their work. In this study, we develop a comprehensive drone training program for research partners and community members to use cost-effective, consumer-quality drones to engage in introductory drone mapping of coastal seagrass monitoring sites along the west coast of North America. As a first step toward a longer-term Public Participation GIS process in the study area, the training program includes lessons for beginner drone users related to flying drones, autonomous route planning and mapping, field safety, GIS analysis, image correction and processing, and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification and regulations. Training our research partners and students, who are in most cases novice users, is the first step in a larger process to increase participation in a broader project for seagrass monitoring in our case study. While our training program originated in the United States, we discuss our experiences for research partners and communities around the globe to become more confident in introductory drone operations for basic science. In particular, our work targets novice users without a strong background in geographic research or remote sensing. Such training provides technical guidance on the implementation of a drone mapping program for coastal research, and synthesizes our approaches to provide broad guidance for using drones in support of a developing Public Participation GIS process.},

  abstract = {People's values and attitudes regarding the natural world determine the level of care with which they approach the use of natural resources. We studied how human relationships with nature influence people's actions, using western redcedar (Thuja plicata), a major forest tree of northwestern North America, as a study system. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with eleven Northwest Coast Indigenous plant experts and eleven ecologists and foresters of mixed European descent with an ecologically-oriented perspective in coastal British Columbia. The transcripts were analyzed using NVivo qualitative data analysis software for emerging themes. Results demonstrate more commonalities than differences between the two groups; they both expressed a personal—often spiritual—connection with nature and both value long-term and interdisciplinary management strategies. First Nation individuals have a unique spiritual relationship with western redcedar that is linked to both everyday and ceremonial practices, while ecologically-based foresters and ecologists have personal and academic relationships broadly with nature. They have similar environmental concerns of damage from industrial forestry practices, particularly the loss of old growth forests, and the negative effects of climate change. Our results support the assertion that First Nation perspectives are equally scholarly as the foresters' perspectives are reverential, and people from varied cultural backgrounds can care for the environment in similar ways. Moreover, an interdisciplinary approach that unifies science with Indigenous teachings can encourage a new moral framework for forestry management that values resources beyond commodification.},
